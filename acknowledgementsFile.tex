This is the acknowledgments tex file, which should have been set in the main file using the command \verb|\setAcknowledgementsFile{Drive:/file/location/acknowledgementsFile}|.

Keep in mind this should be written in first person. Acknowledgments must be written in complete sentences. Do not use direct address. For example, instead of Thanks, Mom and Dad!, you should say I thank my parents.
