%%%                 User Package and Style File loading.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\usepackage{CustomMacros}%  This is a user macro/style file.

\usepackage{tikz}%       tikz is used by almost everyone, but certainly by me for this.
\usepackage{pgfplots}%   pgfplots is tikz but better.
%\usepackage{amsrefs}%   amsrefs contains the .bibtex style content for mathematician papers.
\usepackage[framemethod=TikZ]{mdframed} %For MD Theorem
\usepackage[capitalise]{cleveref}
\usepackage{mathtools}

\creflabelformat{equation}{#2 \textup{#1}#3}
\crefdefaultlabelformat{#2 \textup{#1}#3}

%%%                     User Configuration commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Uncomment the relevant line below if you have tables or figures
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self-explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a co-chair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\title{An Autonomous Method for Measuring 3D Joint Kinematics from 2D Xray Images}%  Put your title here.

\degreeType{Doctorate of Philosophy}%   Official name of your degree; e.g. "Doctorate of Philosophy."
\major{Mechanical Engineering}%                    Your official Department
\author{Andrew James Jensen}%                  Your Name
\thesisType{Dissertation}%              Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{2024}%                      Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{March}%                   Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair{Scott Banks}%                   Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section. 
%       They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't, the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%       So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
%       You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.
%       NOTE: For some compilers, they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
%           If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%           e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{./src/0-Preamble/dedicationFile}%                 Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{./src/0-Preamble/acknowledgementsFile}%     Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{./src/0-Preamble/abstractFile}%                     Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
\setReferenceFile{./src/myBib.bib}{amsplain}%         References. First argument is your bibtex source file
%                                                       the second argument is your bibtex style file.
\setBiographicalFile{./src/0-Preamble/biographyFile}%                Biography file of the Author (you).

%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

\setAbbreviationsFile{./src/0-Preamble/abbreviations}%           Abbreviations Page
%\setAppendixFile{appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
%\multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix, 
%                                                   comment it if you have only one appendix.
