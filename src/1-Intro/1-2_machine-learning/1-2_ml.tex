A notable challenge associated with conventional image processing and filtering techniques is the requirement for manual development and adjustment of filters aimed at feature extraction.
While this manual approach grants researchers substantial control over the filtering process, it is often labor-intensive and difficult to apply broadly across various datasets.
In contrast, deep learning and neural networks present methodologies wherein feature extraction is automated.
This advancement introduces a level of adaptability and robustness in these algorithms, making them more effective in handling novel datasets.
