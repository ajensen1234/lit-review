A significant limitation of traditional image processing and filtering methods has been the necessity to manually create and fine-tune filters for feature extraction.
Although this approach provides researchers with considerable control over filtering techniques, it tends to be time-consuming and challenging to generalize across diverse datasets.
Deep learning and neural networks, however, offer algorithms where feature extraction is automated, introducing techniques that enhance the robustness of these algorithms to novel datasets.
