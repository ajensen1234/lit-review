\subsection{The Telos of Neural Networks for Image Processing}

Neural networks for image processing are an attempt to recreate the visual system in animals, creating algorithmic analogies to the various physical neuronal pathways that are present in the image. Typically, there are many different parts of our visual system that we take for granted, such as the ability to see upside down and extrapolate from prior information. While seemingly intuitive, these are difficult feats to determine algorithmically in a mathematical function.
