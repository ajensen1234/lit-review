Using our knowledge of geometric transformations and projective geometries, we can build up a model of a camera step by step. We standardize our reference frame by having the $z$ direction along the focal direction of the camera, the $x$ direction to the right, and the $y$ direction such that the right-hand rule is maintained. The origin is at the center of the camera.

We will describe the object of interest as a collection of points, $\mathbf{p}_i =  [x_i, y_i, z_i, 1] \text{ for } i = 1,2,\cdots,N$. For a complete picture, any given operation will be performed on all points. For simplicity, the following equations will demonstrate the process on a single point of the object.

First, we need to describe the location and orientation of the object with respect to the camera. This can be done with a 3D homogeneous transformation matrix (translation and rotation) (Eq. \ref{eq:4x4-homog-transformation}).

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\mathbf{p}}' = \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{R}_{3 \times 3} & \mathbf{t}_{3 \times 1} \\ \mathbf{0}_{1 \times 3} & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}
    \label{eq:4x4-homog-transformation}
\end{equation}

Then, we use a projective transformation that determines the perspective scaling between the object's location and the image plane at the focal distance. Geometrically, this relationship can be visualized with similar triangles (\cref{fig:perspective-projection}) and quantified using the ratio of lengths (\cref{eq:perspective-projection}). In these equations, $f'$ is the focal distance in units of length.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{The geometry of perspective projection can be visualized by using similar triangles. The overall scaling of the image is based on the ratio of the focal length to the depth of the object.}
    \label{fig:perspective-projection}
\end{figure}


\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i} &= \begin{bmatrix}
            f' & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & f' & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}' \\
        &\text{where} \\
        x_i &= p_x'\frac{f'}{p_z'} \\
        y_i &= p_y'\frac{f'}{p_z'} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:perspective-projection}
\end{equation}

The standard image reference frame places the origin at the top left corner of the image, with the positive x-direction to the right, and the positive y-direction down. This introduces the idea of the principal point, $(c_x,c_y)$, which is the location where the optical axis of the camera intersects the image plane perpendicularly. In the camera model, the principal point is a translation starting at the image plane's origin (Eq. \ref{eq:principal-point}).


\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i} &= \begin{bmatrix}
            f' & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f' & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}' \\
        &\text{where} \\
        c_x &\approx \frac{W_{image}}{2} \\
        c_y &\approx \frac{H_{image}}{2} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:principal-point}
\end{equation}

Finally, we need to convert the image coordinates, $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i$, to pixel coordinates using the pixel scale factor (Eq.\ref{eq:pixel-scaling}). The pixel scale factor is defined by the parameters $k_x$ and $k_y$, which represent the number of pixels per unit distance in the x and y directions, respectively. By multiplying the perspective projection matrix by the pixel scale factor, we can obtain a new matrix that maps 3D points in world coordinates directly to pixel coordinates on the image.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{pix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
            k_x & 0& 0 \\ 0 & k_y & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
            f' & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f' & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}\tilde{\mathbf{p}}' \\
        & = \begin{bmatrix}
            f_x & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f_y & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}\tilde{\mathbf{p}}'\\
        &\text{where}\\
        f_x &= k_x f' \text{        and        } f_y = k_y f' \\
        &\text{Are focal distances in units of pixels} 
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:pixel-scaling}
\end{equation}

At this point, we have placed an object in front of a camera using 3D transformations, and then projected the points of that object onto the image plane using a camera matrix and projective transform. A simple silhouette rasterization of the image would simply fill in the pixel values interpolated between each of the discrete points obtained from this projection. Generating a photo-realistic image would involve coloring, shading, and ray tracing, but this is unnecessary for this dissertation, and will not be discussed.
