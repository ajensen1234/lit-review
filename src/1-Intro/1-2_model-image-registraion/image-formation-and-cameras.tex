Using our knowledge of geometric transformations and projective geometries, we can build up a model of a camera step by step. We standardize our reference frame by having the $z$ direction along the focal direction of the camera, the $x$ direction to the right, and the $y$ direction such that the right-hand rule is maintained. The origin is at the center of the camera.

We will describe the object of interest as a collection of points, $\mathbf{p} =  [x_i, y_i, z_i, 1] \text{ for } i = 1,2,\cdots,N$. For a complete picture, any given operation will be performed on all points. For simplicity, the following equations will demonstrate the process on a single point of the object.

First, we need to describe the location and orientation of the object with respect to the camera. This can be done with a 3D homogeneous transformation matrix (translation and rotation) (Eq. \ref{eq:4x4-homog-transformation}).

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\mathbf{p}}' = \begin{bmatrix}
        R_{3 \times 3} & \mathbf{t}_{3 \times 1} \\ \mathbf{0}_{1 \times 3} & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}
    \label{eq:4x4-homog-transformation}
\end{equation}

Then, we use a projective transformation that determines the perspective scaling between the objects actual location and the image place at the focal distance. Geometrically, this relationship can be visualized with similar triangles (Fig. \ref{fig:perspective-projection}), and quantified using the ratio of lengths (Eq. \ref{eq:perspective-projection}). In these equations, $f'$ is the focal distance in units of length.

    \caption{The geometry of perspective projection can be visualized by using similar triangles. The overall scaling of the image is based on the ratio of the focal length to the depth of the object.}
    \label{fig:perspective-projection}
\end{figure}


\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i} &= \begin{bmatrix}
            f' & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & f' & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}' \\
        &\text{where} \\
        x_i &= p_x'\frac{f'}{p_z'} \\
        y_i &= p_y'\frac{f'}{p_z'} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:perspective-projection}
\end{equation}

In computer graphics, the principal point, $(c_x,c_y)$ is a key element in the mathematical model of a camera. It is the point where the optical axis of the camera intersects the image plane, and is typically near the center of the image. The principal point is important because it determines the perspective of the image: objects that are farther away from the principal point will appear smaller in the image, while objects that are closer to the principal point will appear larger. When dealing with the shift between the reference frame embedded in the object and the reference frame embedded in the image plane, the principal point acts as a translation (Eq. \ref{eq:principal-point}).


\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i} &= \begin{bmatrix}
            f' & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f' & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}' \\
        &\text{where} \\
        c_x &\approx \frac{W_{image}}{2} \\
        c_y &\approx \frac{H_{image}}{2} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:principal-point}
\end{equation}

Finally, we need to convert the image coordinates, $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i$, to pixel coordinates using the pixel scale factor (Eq.\ref{eq:pixel-scaling}). The pixel scale factor is defined by the parameters $k_x$ and $k_y$, which represent the number of pixels per unit distance in the x and y directions, respectively. By multiplying the perspective projection matrix by the pixel scale factor, we can obtain a new matrix that maps 3D points in world coordinates directly to pixel coordinates on the image.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{pix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
            k_x & 0& 0 \\ 0 & k_y & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
            f' & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f' & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix} \\
        & = \begin{bmatrix}
            f_x & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f_y & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}\\
        &\text{where}\\
        f_x &= k_x f' \text{        and        } f_y = k_y f' \\
        &\text{Are focal distances in units of pixels} 
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:pixel-scaling}
\end{equation}
