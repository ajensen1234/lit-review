% Talk about some of the limitations (needing to help the optimizer), and mention that most of them needed a human operator, but without an operator necessary, this should be pretty fire.

When we are determining the final pose of the TKA implant, there are two features that need to be selected: (1) the objective function and (2) optimization routine. THe availability of the segmentation output from the High-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network and an inital pose estimate from Normalized Fourier Descriptors helps narrow the choices down.
