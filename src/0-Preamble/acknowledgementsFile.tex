First, I would like to thank my parents for their continued support throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies. They fostered my work ethic and drive to get through something as ambitious as a doctorate.

Secondly, I would like to thank my advisor, Scott Banks. He has truly been something of a second dad to me as I navigate through graduate school and my future career. Though most conversations seem to revolve around either beer, music, or hiking, we seem to have gotten quite a lot done.

Third, I would like to thank my wife, Lauren. Though busy with medical school, she still takes the time to understand my research and offer support outside of academics.
