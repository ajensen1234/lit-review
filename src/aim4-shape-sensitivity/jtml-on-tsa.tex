\subsection{Introduction}
The successful application of Joint Track Machine Learning (JTML) to Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implants suggested potential applicability to other implant types and joints.
This hypothesis was supported by JTML's robust performance across varied TKA implant styles, including posterior stabilized and cruciate retaining designs, and differences in the peg design of the tibial baseplate.
Consequently, we replicated the TKA experimentation framework, applying it to Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) implant data, to assess whether this success could be mirrored in a different joint context.

\subsection{Methods}
We sourced 823 post-operative reverse TSA (rTSA) images with human-supervised kinematics from Nagoya University, adhering to IRB guidelines.
These images were obtained using single-plane fluoroscopy to measure glenohumeral kinematics in patients performing anonymized movements.
The collected data for each patient included deidentified radiographic images, imaging calibration files, and manufacturer-supplied glenoid and humeral implant surface geometry files.


We employed the same convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture previously used for TKA implants \cite{wangDeepHighResolutionRepresentation2020} (\cref{sec:jtml}) maintaining an 80/20 training/testing split.
A key consideration was the relative scarcity of rTSA images compared to TKA.
To address this, we augmented the training set with non-affine transformations, specifically grid distortion and elastic transform \cite{buslaevAlbumentationsFastFlexible2020}.
While such transformations increased training times in the TKA pipeline, their computational intensity was manageable given the smaller rTSA image dataset, enhancing the network's generalization capability for rTSA image segmentation.

Next, we applied the DIRECT-JTA algorithm from the JTML suite to rTSA images, evaluating our autonomous kinematics measurement platform.
The efficacy of the algorithms will be assessed by comparing the root-mean-square difference between autonomous and human-supervised kinematic measurements on this novel test set.
