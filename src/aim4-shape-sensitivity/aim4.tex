 \chapter{This Will Definitely Work on Shoulder Implants, Right?}

\section{Introduction}
Another common arthroplasty (TSA) procedure is total shoulder replacement, which involves the removal and replacement of the distal end of the glenoid/scapula and the proximal end of the humeral head.
For many of the reasons that researchers, implant manufacturers, and surgeons are interested in quantifying post-op TKA kinematics, they are also interested in exploring post-op TSA kinematics.
Though the exact numbers differ from TKA outcomes, there is still a large percentage of patients receiving TSA that express dissatisfaction, citing main mechanical limitations or instability as the primary causes.

For the past twenty years, researchers have explored both anatomical and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty kinematics \cite{kijimaVivo3dimensionalAnalysis2015,matsukiVivo3DAnalysis2014,matsukiDynamicVivoGlenohumeral2012,sugiComparingVivoThreedimensional2021,burtonFullyAutomaticTracking2023}, attempting to draw connections between different implants and surgical techniques to postoperative shoulder dynamics and range of motion.
For the same reasons that a reliable, fast, clinically practical, and fully-autonomous kinematics measurement platform would be desirable for clinicians operating on post-operative total knee arthroplasty (\cref{sec:jtml}), it would also be desirable for clinicians working on total shoulder arthroplasty.
