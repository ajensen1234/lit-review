 \chapter{This Will Definitely Work on Shoulder Implants, Right?}

\section{Introduction}
Another common arthroplasty (TSA) procedure is total shoulder replacement, which involves the removal and replacement of the distal end of the glenoid/scapula and the proximal end of the humeral head.
And, for many of the reasons that researchers, implant manufacturers, and surgeons are interested in quantifying post-op TKA kinematics, they are also interested in exploring post-op TSA kinematics.
