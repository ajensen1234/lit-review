A total of 30 UKAs implanted in 18 patients were analyzed. All patients were implanted with a medial Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee System (Zimmer Inc, Warsaw, Ind). Under fluoroscopic surveillance, each patient performed weight-bearing deep knee bend, normal gait, and passive flexion. The kinematics of the medial UKA was determined using a 3-dimensional model registration technique. On average, the implant experienced posterior femoral rollback and normal axial rotation during flexion. However, the kinematic patterns for each patient were not consistent, and the variability was high during flexion and stance phase of gait. Key words: UKA, in vivo, kinematics, fluoroscopic surveillance, minimally invasive techniques.},

  abstract = {Several pathologies can alter the way people walk, i.e. their gait. Gait analysis can therefore be used to detect impairments and help diagnose illnesses and assess patient recovery. Using vision-based systems, diagnoses could be done at home or in a clinic, with the needed computation being done remotely. State-of-the-art vision-based gait analysis systems use deep learning, requiring large datasets for training. However, to our best knowledge, the biggest publicly available pathological gait dataset contains only 10 subjects, simulating 4 gait pathologies. This paper presents a new dataset called GAIT-IT, captured from 21 subjects simulating 4 gait pathologies, with 2 severity levels, besides normal gait, being considerably larger than publicly available gait pathology datasets, allowing to train a deep learning model for gait pathology classification. Moreover, it was recorded in a professional studio, making it possible to obtain nearly perfect silhouettes, free of segmentation errors. Recognizing the importance of remote healthcare, this paper proposes a prototype of a web application allowing to upload a walking person's video, possibly acquired using a smartphone camera, and execute a web service that classifies the person's gait as normal or across different pathologies. The web application has a user friendly interface and could be used by healthcare professionals or other end users. An automatic gait analysis system is also developed and integrated with the web application for pathology classification. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, it achieves a drastic reduction in the number of model parameters, which means significantly lower memory requirements, as well as lower training and execution times. Classification accuracy is on par with the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {A new technique is presented that utilizes relative velocity vectors between articulating surfaces to characterize internal/external rotation of the tibio-femoral joint during dynamic loading. Precise tibiofemoral motion was determined by tracking the movement of implanted tantalum beads in high-speed biplane X-rays. Three-dimensional, subject-specific CT reconstructions of the femur and tibia, consisting of triangular mesh elements, were positioned in each analyzed frame. The minimum distance between subchondral bone surfaces was recorded for each mesh element comprising each bone surface, and the relative velocity between these opposing closest surface elements was determined in each frame. Internal/external rotation was visualized by superimposing tangential relative velocity vectors onto bone surfaces at each instant. Rotation about medial and lateral compartments was quantified by calculating the angle between these tangential relative vectors within each compartment. Results acquired from 68 test sessions involving 23 dogs indicated a consistent pattern of sequential rotation about the lateral condyle (approximately 60 ms after paw strike) followed by rotation about the medial condyle (approximately 100 ms after paw strike). These results imply that axial knee rotation follows a repeatable pattern within and among subjects. This pattern involves rotation about both the lateral and medial compartments. The technique described can be easily applied to study human knee internal/external rotation during a variety of activities. This information may be useful to define normal and pathologic conditions, to confirm post-surgical restoration of knee mechanics, and to design more realistic prosthetic devices. Furthermore, analysis of joint arthrokinematics, such as those described, may identify changes in joint mechanics associated with joint degeneration.},

This provides greater stability in flexion by creating a greater jump distance and reduces the stress on the tibial spine. In order to eliminate edge loading of the femoral component on the posterior tibial articular surface, the posterior femoral condyles need to be extended. This provides an ideal femoral contact with the tibial articular surface during high flexion angles. To reduce extensor mechanism impingement in deep flexion, the anterior margin of the tibial articular component should be recessed. This provides clearance for the patella and patella tendon.},

Because the motions of total knee implants have a direct influence on patient function and device longevity, it is important to understand how knee implants based on a variety of design philosophies perform in vivo. Fifty-nine knees in patients with 5 designs of implants were studied with fluoroscopic imaging during gait and stair-climbing activities. Many knees showed significantly different kinematics between the gait and stair activities, as well as differences from knees having other implant designs. The measured motions were consistent with the intrinsic constraint provided by the implant components and the variation in constraint over the flexion range.

Three groups of knee arthroplasty subjects with excellent clinical outcomes and similar ranges of motion were evaluated. Each group received different prosthetic components and surgical treatments of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Group 1 had relatively fiat articular surfaces with retention of the bony insertion of the PCL, group 2 had similar articular geometry but recessed the PCL without retaining the bony insertion, and group 3 had prostheses with greater sagittal conformity and post/cam substitution of the sacrificed PCL. Although none of the knees exhibited normal knee kinematics, the ranges of axial rotation and condylar translation for group 1 were similar to ranges previously reported for normal and anterior cruciate-deficient knees. Axial rotations and condylar translations decreased w h e n the PCL was surgically recessed or substituted. The smallest kinematic ranges were observed in group 3.

  abstract = {Background: Patients after primary hip or knee replacement surgery can benefit from postoperative treatment in terms of improvement of independence in ambulation, transfers, range of motion and muscle strength. After discharge from hospital, patients are referred to different treatment destination and modalities: intensive inpatient rehabilitation (IR), cure (medically prescribed stay at a convalescence center), or ambulatory treatment (AT) at home. The purpose of this study was to 1) measure functional health (primary outcome) and function relevant factors in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty and to compare them in relation to three postoperative management strategies: AT, Cure and IR and 2) compare the post-operative changes in patient's health status (between preoperative and the 6 month follow-up) for three rehabilitation settings. Methods: Natural observational, prospective two-center study with follow-up. Sociodemographic data and functional mobility tests, Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Iowa Level of Assistance Scale (ILOAS) of 201 patients were analysed before arthroplasty and at the end of acute hospital stay (mean duration of stay: 9.7 days +/- 3.9). Changes in health state were measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) before and 6 months after arthroplasty. Results: Compared to patients referred for IR and Cure, patients referred for AT were significantly younger and less comorbid. Patients admitted to IR had the highest functional disability before arthroplasty. Before rehabilitation, mean TUG was 40.0 s in the IR group, 33.9 s in the Cure group, and 27.5 s in the AT group, and corresponding mean ILOAS was 16.0, 13.0 and 12.2 (50.0 = worst). At the 6 months follow-up, the corresponding effect sizes of the WOMAC global score were 1.32, 1.87, and 1.51 ({$>$}0 means improvement). Conclusions: Age, comorbidity and functional disability are associated with referral for intensive inpatient rehabilitation after hip or knee arthroplasty and partly affect health changes after rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Background: Accurately measuring in-vivo motion of the knee's patellofemoral (PF) joint is challenging. Conventional measurement techniques have largely been unable to accurately measure three-dimensional, in-vivo motion of the patella during dynamic activities. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based technique for measuring PF joint motion. Methods: To assess the accuracy of this technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the femur and patella of three cadaveric knee specimens and then recorded dynamic biplane radiographic images while manually flexing and extending the specimen. The position of the femur and patella were measured from the biplane images using both the model-based tracking system and a validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. Model-based tracking was compared to dynamic RSA by computing measures of bias, precision, and overall dynamic accuracy of four clinically-relevant kinematic parameters (patellar shift, flexion, tilt, and rotation). Results: The model-based tracking technique results were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated errors of less than 0.395 mm for patellar shift, 0.875\textdegree{} for flexion, 0.863\textdegree{} for tilt, and 0.877\textdegree{} for rotation. Conclusion: This model-based tracking technique is a non-invasive method for accurately measuring dynamic PF joint motion under in-vivo conditions. The technique is sufficiently accurate in measuring clinically relevant changes in PF joint motion following conservative or surgical treatment.},

  abstract = {Shoulder motion is complex and significant research efforts have focused on measuring glenohumeral joint motion. Unfortunately, conventional motion measurement techniques are unable to measure glenohumeral joint kinematics during dynamic shoulder motion to clinically significant levels of accuracy. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of a new model-based tracking technique for measuring three-dimensional, in vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics. We have developed a model-based tracking technique for accurately measuring in vivo joint motion from biplane radiographic images that tracks the position of bones based on their three-dimensional shape and texture. To validate this technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the humerus and scapula of both shoulders from three cadaver specimens and then recorded biplane radiographic images of the shoulder while manually moving each specimen's arm. The position of the humerus and scapula were measured using the model-based tracking system and with a previously validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. Accuracy was reported in terms of measurement bias, measurement precision, and overall dynamic accuracy by comparing the model-based tracking results to the dynamic RSA results. The model-based tracking technique produced results that were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Measurement bias ranged from -0.126to0.199mm for the scapula and ranged from -0.022to0.079mm for the humerus. Dynamic measurement precision was better than 0.130mm for the scapula and 0.095mm for the humerus. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated that rms errors in any one direction were less than 0.385mm for the scapula and less than 0.374mm for the humerus. These errors correspond to rotational inaccuracies of approximately 0.25deg for the scapula and 0.47deg for the humerus. This new model-based tracking approach represents a non-invasive technique for accurately measuring dynamic glenohumeral joint motion under in vivo conditions. The model-based technique achieves accuracy levels that far surpass all previously reported non-invasive techniques for measuring in vivo glenohumeral joint motion. This technique is supported by a rigorous validation study that provides a realistic simulation of in vivo conditions and we fully expect to achieve these levels of accuracy with in vivo human testing. Future research will use this technique to analyze shoulder motion under a variety of testing conditions and to investigate the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears on dynamic joint stability.},

The algorithm was evaluated using controlled conditions and standard geometries. Results of the validation demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and capability of realizing a pose from a variety of initial poses. Under idealized conditions, poses of a TKA system were recreated to within 0.02{$\pm$}0.01 mm and 0.02{$\pm$}0.03 deg for the femoral component and 0.07{$\pm$}0.09 mm and 0.16{$\pm$}0.18 deg for the tibial component. By employing a standardized geometry with spheres, the translational accuracy and repeatability under actual conditions was found to be 0.01{$\pm$}0.06 mm. Application of the optimized matching algorithm to a TKA patient showed that the pose of in-vivo TKA components can be repeatedly located, with standard deviations less than {$\pm$}0.12 mm and {$\pm$}0.12 deg for the femoral component and {$\pm$}0.29 mm and {$\pm$}0.25 deg for the tibial component. This methodology presents a useful tool that can be readily applied to the investigation of in-vivo motion of TKA kinematics.},

Contrary to explicit representations, they have no resolution limitations and they easily deal with a wide variety of surface topologies. To learn these implicit representations, current approaches rely on a certain level of shape supervision (e.g., inside/outside information or distance-to-shape knowledge), or at least require a dense point cloud (to approximate well enough the distance-to-shape). In contrast, we introduce \{\textbackslash method\}, an self-supervised method for learning shape representations from possibly extremely sparse point clouds. Like in Buffon's needle problem, we "drop" (sample) needles on the point cloud and consider that, statistically, close to the surface, the needle end points lie on opposite sides of the surface. No shape knowledge is required and the point cloud can be highly sparse, e.g., as lidar point clouds acquired by vehicles. Previous self-supervised shape representation approaches fail to produce good-quality results on this kind of data. We obtain quantitative results on par with existing supervised approaches on shape reconstruction datasets and show promising qualitative results on hard autonomous driving datasets such as KITTI.},

  abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.             Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.  These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,  and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

Significant human effort associated with manual tracking presents a major bottleneck in biomechanics research methods and limits the scale of target applications. The current work introduces a method for fully-automatic tracking of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics in stereo-radiography sequences for subjects performing dynamic activities. The proposed method involves the application of convolutional neural networks for annotating radiographs and a multi-stage optimization pipeline for estimating bone pose based on information provided by neural net predictions. Predicted kinematics are evaluated by comparing against manually-tracked trends across 20 distinct trials. Median absolute differences below 1.5millimeters or degrees for 6 tibiofemoral and 3 patellofemoral degrees of freedom demonstrate the utility of our approach, which improves upon previous semi-automatic methods by enabling end-to-end automation. Implementation of a fully-automatic pipeline for kinematic tracking will benefit evaluation of human movement by enabling large-scale studies of healthy knee kinematics.},

Moreover, image processing speed varies in existing image augmentation libraries. We present Albumentations, a fast and flexible open source library for image augmentation with many various image transform operations available that is also an easy-to-use wrapper around other augmentation libraries.

  abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been been argued for. This thesis is an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture as directly as possible the desirable properties of an edge operator. Variational techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all linear shift invariant operators. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points should b The third criterion is that there should be low probability of more than one response to a single edge. The technique is used to find optimal operators for step edges and for extended impulse profiles (ridges or valleys in two dimensions). The extension of the one dimensional operators to two dimensions is then discussed. The result is a set of operators of varying width, length and orientation. The problem of combining these outputs into a single description is discussed, and a set of heuristics for the integration are given. (Author)},

  abstract = {We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that adversarial robustness can significantly benefit from semisupervised learning. Theoretically, we revisit the simple Gaussian model of Schmidt et al. [41] that shows a sample complexity gap between standard and robust classification. We prove that unlabeled data bridges this gap: a simple semisupervised learning procedure (self-training) achieves high robust accuracy using the same number of labels required for achieving high standard accuracy. Empirically, we augment CIFAR-10 with 500K unlabeled images sourced from 80 Million Tiny Images and use robust self-training to outperform state-of-the-art robust accuracies by over 5 points in (i) `1 robustness against several strong attacks via adversarial training and (ii) certified `2 and `1 robustness via randomized smoothing. On SVHN, adding the dataset's own extra training set with the labels removed provides gains of 4 to 10 points, within 1 point of the gain from using the extra labels.},

We performed intraoperative kinematic measurements using a navigation system to study knee kinematics before and after posterior substituting rotating platform total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We verified intraoperatively (1) if varus/valgus (VV) laxity and anterior/posterior (AP) laxity were restored after TKA; (2) if TKA induced abnormal femoral rollback; and (3) how tibial axial rotation was influenced by TKA throughout the range of flexion. We found that TKA improved alignment in preoperative osteoarthritic varus knees which became neutral after surgery and maintained a neutral alignment in neutral knees. The VV stability at 0\textdegree{} was restored while AP laxity at 90\textdegree{} significantly increased after TKA. Following TKA, the femur had an abnormal anterior translation up to 60\textdegree{} of flexion, followed by a small rollback of 12 {$\pm$} 5 mm. TKA influenced the tibia rotation pattern during flexion, but not the total amount of internal/external rotation throughout whole range of flexion, which was preserved after TKA (6\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 5\textdegree ). This study showed that the protocol proposed might be useful to adjust knee stability at time zero and that knee kinematic outcome during total knee replacement can be monitored by a navigation system.},

Screening for ROIs is a tedious and timeconsuming visual recognition task which can be exhausting. The cognitive workload could be reduced by developing a visual aid to narrow down the visual search area by highlighting (or segmenting) regions of diagnostic relevance, enabling pathologists to spend more time diagnosing relevant ROIs. In this paper, we propose HistoSegNet, a method for semantic segmentation of histological tissue type (HTT). Using the HTT-annotated Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP) database, we train a Convolutional Neural Network on the patch annotations, infer Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps, average overlapping predictions, and postprocess the segmentation with a fully-connected Conditional Random Field. Our method out-performs more complicated weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods and can generalize to other datasets without retraining.},

The lack of such information for the elbow has motivated the present study. An attempt is therefore made to measure the rotatory component of cadaver elbows under passive motion. The results obtained will be used to Justify certain noninvasive means to measure three-dimensional angular motion for hving subjects. Using biplanar radiographs, cadaver forearms were studied under the passive motions of flexion-extensIOn and supination-pronation. The coordmate axes for the forearm, radius and ulna were defined based on imbedded Kirschner wires The three-dimensional rotation of the forearm with respect to the humerus, as well as the relative motion among the radius, ulna and humerus, were analyzed based on Eulerian angles. The relationship between the primary modes of motion and the inherent secondary motion was defined and analyzed. No translatIOnal motion within the joint was considered because of the tight constraint of the ligamentous structure. However, this hypothesis was exammed by momtoring the vanation of the displacement of the moving coordmate center The implications of these findings to the surgical treatment of elbow problems were speculated on.},

  abstract = {With the strength of deep generative models, 3D pose transfer regains intensive research interests in recent years. Existing methods mainly rely on a variety of constraints to achieve the pose transfer over 3D meshes, e.g., the need for manually encoding for shape and pose disentanglement. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to conduct the pose transfer between any arbitrate given 3D meshes. Specifically, a novel Intrinsic-Extrinsic Preserved Generative Adversarial Network (IEP-GAN) is presented for both intrinsic (i.e., shape) and extrinsic (i.e., pose) information preservation. Extrinsically, we propose a co-occurrence discriminator to capture the structural/pose invariance from distinct Laplacians of the mesh. Meanwhile, intrinsically, a local intrinsic-preserved loss is introduced to preserve the geodesic priors while avoiding heavy computations. At last, we show the possibility of using IEP-GAN to manipulate 3D human meshes in various ways, including pose transfer, identity swapping and pose interpolation with latent code vector arithmetic. The extensive experiments on various 3D datasets of humans, animals and hands qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the generality of our approach. Our proposed model produces better results and is substantially more efficient compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. Code is available: https://github.com/mikecheninoulu/Unsupervised\_IEPGAN},

This paper introduces a variant of the full NIST dataset, which we have called Extended MNIST (EMNIST), which follows the same conversion paradigm used to create the MNIST dataset. The result is a dataset that constitutes a more challenging classification task involving letters and digits, and one that shares the same image structure and parameters as the original MNIST task, allowing for direct compatibility with all existing classifiers and systems. Benchmark results using an online ELM algorithm are presented along with a validation of the conversion process through the comparison of the classification results on NIST digits and the MNIST digits.},

Adjustments to the pose variables and shape para meters are calculated. Limits are placed on the shape parameters ensur ing that the example can only deform into shapes conforming to global constraints imposed by the training set. An iterative procedure deforms the model example to find the best fit to the image object. Results of ap plying the method are described.

The tibiofemoral contact point (CP) moves anteriorly and produces a decrease in the lever arm of the extensor apparatus. This can provoke patellofemoral, tibiofemoral-joint pain and instability for the patient. In order to quantify the amount of paradoxical motion on a 90\textdegree{} flexion radiograph of the knee, the average normal CP of the natural knee should be known. There are no known CP measurement methods suited for natural knees and knees with TKR that can be applied in daily practice, and only estimations for the CP position have been made. Therefore, a CP measurement technique on lateral radiographs that can be applied to natural knees and knees with a TKR has been developed. The reproducibility of this method was assessed. It was then used to determine the normal range of the CP in natural knees. The medial contact point in the natural knee in 90\textdegree{} of flexion was determined to be at 68\% ({$\pm$}6.6\%) of the AP diameter of the tibia measured below the tibia-plateau simulating a bone resection with TKR. This reproducible CP measurement method can be used clinically to evaluate the CP after knee prosthesis and also in patients with suspected ligament lesions.},

Patient-specific bone models were derived from computed tomography (CT) data. 3D computer bone models of each subject's femur, tibia, and fibula were recreated from the CT 3D bone density data. Using a model-based 3D-to-2D imaging technique registered CT images were precisely fit onto fluoroscopic images, the full six degrees of freedom motion of the bones was measured from the images. The computer-generated 3D models of each subject's femur and tibia were precisely registered to the 2D digital fluoroscopic images using an optimization algorithm that automatically adjusts the pose of the model at various flexion/extension angles. Each subject performed a weightbearing deep knee bend while under dynamic fluoroscopic surveillance. All 10 normal knees experienced posterior femoral translation of the lateral condyle and minimal change in position of the medial condyle with progressive knee flexion. The average amount of posterior femoral translation of the lateral condyle was 21.07 mm, whereas the average medial condyle translation was 1.94 mm, in the posterior direction. In contrast, all five ACLD knees experienced considerable change in the position of the medial condyle. The average amount of posterior femoral translation of the lateral condyle was 17.00 mm, while the medial condyle translation was 4.65 mm, in the posterior direction. In addition, the helical axis of motion was determined between maximum flexion and extension. A considerable difference was found between the center of rotation locations of the normal and ACLD subjects, with ACLD subjects exhibiting substantially higher variance in kinematic patterns.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a complete method estimating the displacement field of bodies constrained by an articulated model such as the neck area. Indeed bony structures between different patient images, such as vertebras, may rigidly move while other tissues may deform. The method is divided into 3 steps. The method first registers the articulated rigid bodies together. Then it propagates the deformation into the whole volume through the use of a tetrahedral mesh and it finishes the registration using a mutual information based optical flow. Following the ITK framework, it uses a fast stochastic gradient descent optimization strategy chosen to maximize the mutual information metric. We demonstrate this method provides accurate results on 3D CT, MR and PET images.},

  abstract = {Fluoroscopic imaging has become increasingly popular to investigate total knee arthroplasty kinematics non-invasively \`A 3D implant models are aligned with 2D image projections, and optimized via an edgecontour alignment technique. Previous studies have quantified the accuracy of this approach, however they do not always adequately address the impact of image collection parameters. A particularly sensitive parameter is the pulse width, or exposure time per frame. At longer pulse widths, more motion is captured in a single frame; this can lead to image blur and subsequent degradation to image edge quality. Therefore, the comparative accuracy of relative joint kinematics as a function of pulse width and joint velocity needs to be defined. A limits of agreement approach was taken to define the mean differences between optoelectric kinematic measures (gold standard) and fluoroscopic methods at various pulse widths (1, 8 and 16 ms) and knee velocities (50, 100 and 225\textdegree/s). The mean absolute differences between the optoelectric and fluoroscopic methods for 1 ms pulse width were less than 1.5\textdegree{} and 0.9 mm. Comparable rotational differences (1.3\textdegree ) were observed for the 8 ms pulse width but had larger translational differences (1.4 mm). The 16 ms pulse width yielded the greatest mean differences (2.0\textdegree{} and 1.6 mm), which increased with knee flexion velocity. The importance of pulse width and velocity should not be overlooked for future studies \textendash{} this parameter has proven to be a sensitive metric in the quantification of joint motion via fluoroscopy and must be identified and reported in future studies.},

This study identified sagittal implant position which may predict improved outcomes using machine learning algorithms. Methods: A retrospective review of 1091 consecutive TKAs was performed. All TKAs were posterior cruciate ligament retaining or sacrificing with an anterior-lip (49.4\%) or conforming bearing (50.6\%) and performed with modern perioperative protocols. Preoperative and postoperative tibial slope and postoperative femoral component flexion were measured with standardized radiographic protocols. Analysis groups were categorized by satisfaction scores and the Knee Society Score question `does this knee feel normal to you?' Machine learning algorithms were used to identify optimal sagittal alignment zones that predict superior satisfaction and knees ``always feeling normal'' scores. Results: Mean age and median body mass index were 66 years and 34 kg/m2, respectively, with 67\% being female. The machine learning model predicted an increased likelihood of being ``satisfied or very satisfied'' and a knee ``always feeling normal'' with a change in tibial slope closer to native (\`A2 to \th 2 ) and femoral component flexion 0 to \th 7 . Worse outcomes were predicted with any femoral component extension, femoral component flexion beyond \th 10 , and adding or removing {$>$}5  of native tibial slope. Conclusion: Superior patient-reported outcomes were predicted with approximating native tibial slope and incorporating some femoral component flexion. Deviation from native tibial slope and excessive femoral flexion or any femoral component extension were predictive of worse outcomes.},

Methods: Dynamic stereo X-ray was used to quantify tibiofemoral joint contact mechanics and frontal-plane motion during the loading response phase of downhill gait in 11 patients with knee OA and 11 control volunteers. Quantitative testing of the quadriceps and the hip abductor muscles was also performed. Results: Patients with knee OA demonstrated larger medial/lateral joint contact point excursions (p b 0.02) and greater heel-strike joint contact point velocities (p b 0.05) for the medial and lateral compartments compared to the control group. The peak medial/lateral joint contact point velocity of the medial compartment was also greater for patients with knee OA compared to their control counterparts (p = 0.02). Additionally, patients with knee OA demonstrated significantly increased frontal-plane varus motion excursions (p b 0.01) and greater quadriceps and hip abductor muscle weakness (p = 0.03). In general, increased joint contact point excursions and velocities in patients with knee OA were linearly associated with greater frontal-plane varus motion excursions (p b 0.04) but not with quadriceps or hip abductor strength. Conclusion: Altered contact mechanics in patients with knee OA may be related to compromised frontal-plane joint stability but not with deficits in muscle strength.},

While so far these assumptions have only been evaluated for simplified point-mass or planar models, we address the question of whether they can predict reaching movements in a full skeletal model of the human upper extremity. We learn a control policy using a motor babbling approach as implemented in reinforcement learning, using aimed movements of the tip of the right index finger towards randomly placed 3D targets of varying size. We use a state-of-the-art biomechanical model, which includes seven actuated degrees of freedom. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we use a simplified second-order muscle model, acting at each degree of freedom instead of individual muscles. The results confirm that the assumptions of signal-dependent and constant motor noise, together with the objective of movement time minimization, are sufficient for a state-of-the-art skeletal model of the human upper extremity to reproduce complex phenomena of human movement, in particular Fitts' Law and the                                                   \$\$\textbackslash frac\{2\}\{3\}\$\$                                                               2                       3                                                                                       Power Law.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for reconstruction of 3D shapes using a few x-ray views and a statistical model. In many applications of surgery such as orthopedics, it is desirable to define a surgical planning on 3-D images and then to execute the plan using standard registration techniques and image-guided surgery systems. But the cost, time and x-ray dose associated with standard pre-operative Computed Tomography makes it difficult to use this methodology for rather standard interventions. Instead, we propose to use a few x-ray images generated from a C-Arm and to build the 3-D shape of the patient bones or organs intra-operatively, by deforming a statistical 3-D model to the contours segmented on the x-ray views. In this paper, we concentrate on the application of our method to bone reconstruction. The algorithm starts from segmented contours of the bone on the x-ray images and an initial estimate of the pose of the 3-D model in the common coordinate system of the set of x-ray projections. The statistical model is made of a few principal modes that are sufficient to represent the normal anatomy. Those modes are built by using a generalization of the Cootes and Taylor method to 3-D surface models, previously published in MICCAI'98 by the authors. Fitting the model to the contours is achieved by using a generalization of the Iterative Closest Point Algorithm to nonrigid 3D/2D registration. For pathological shapes, the statistical model is not valid and subsequent local refinement is necessary. First results are presented for a 3-D statistical model of the distal part of the femur.},

Forces and soft tissues are excluded. To measure movement, the articular surfaces and natural or inserted movement markers must be imaged by some combination of MRI, CT, RSA or fluoroscopy. With the aid of computer-imaging, the movements can then be related to an anatomy-based co-ordinate system to avoid kinematic cross-talk. Methods of depicting these movements which are understandable to engineers and clinicians are discussed. The shapes of the articular surfaces are reported. They are relevant to landmarks and co-ordinate systems and form a basis for inferring the nature of the movements which take place in the knee. The movements of the condyles are described from hyperextension to full passive flexion. Medially the condyle hardly moves antero-posteriorly from 0  to 120  but the contact area transfers from an anterior pair of tibio-femoral surfaces at 10  to a posterior pair at about 30 . Thus because of the shapes of the bones, the medial contact area moves backwards with flexion to 30  but the condyle does not. Laterally the femoral condyle and the contact area move posteriorly but to a variable extent in the mid-range causing tibial internal rotation to occur with flexion around a medial axis. From 120  to full flexion both condyles roll back onto the posterior horn so that the tibio-femoral joint subluxes.},

  abstract = {Wear of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bearings in total knee replacements remains a major limitation to the longevity of these clinically successful devices. Few design tools are currently available to predict mild wear in implants based on varying kinematics, loads, and material properties. This paper reports the implementation of a computer modeling approach that uses fluoroscopically measured motions as inputs and predicts patient-specific implant damage using computationally efficient dynamic contact and tribological analyses. Multibody dynamic simulations of two activities (gait and stair) with two loading conditions (70\textendash 30 and 50\textendash 50 medial\textendash lateral load splits) were generated from fluoroscopic data to predict contact pressure and slip velocity time histories for individual elements on the tibial insert surface. These time histories were used in a computational wear analysis to predict the depth of damage due to wear and creep experienced by each element. Predicted damage areas, volumes, and maximum depths were evaluated against a tibial insert retrieved from the same patient who provided the in vivo motions. Overall, the predicted damage was in close agreement with damage observed on the retrieval. The gait and stair simulations separately predicted the correct location of maximum damage on the lateral side, whereas a combination of gait and stair was required to predict the correct location on the medial side. Predicted maximum damage depths were consistent with the retrieval as well. Total computation time for each damage prediction was less than 30 min. Continuing refinement of this approach will provide a robust tool for accurately predicting clinically relevant wear in total knee replacements.},

To compensate for the effects of STA and improve the accuracy of motion analysis, it is critical to understand the behavior and characteristics of soft tissue movement. By using a non-invasive approach, this study investigated the soft tissue movement on the thigh and shank of twenty healthy subjects during level walking which is one of the most important human daily activities and the basic content of clinical gait analysis. With the measurement of inter-marker translations and rotations on each segment, a 4D picture (3D space and time) of soft tissue deformation on the thigh and shank during walking was quantified in terms of the positional and orientational change between different skin locations. Soft tissue deformation showed nonuniform distribution at different locations as well as along different directions. The range of inter-marker movement was found to be up to 19.1 mm/19.61 on the thigh and 9.3 mm/8.61 on the shank. Results in this study provide useful information for understanding soft tissue movement behavior and exploring better marker configurations. Inter-marker movement exhibited similar patterns across subjects. This finding suggests the possibility that STA has inter-subject similarity, which is contrary to the prevailing opinion. This new insight may lead to more effective STA compensation strategies for skin marker-based motion analysis.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of this study was that the polyethylene bearing in a rotating platform total knee prosthesis shows axial rotation during a step-up motion, thereby facilitating the theoretical advantages of mobile-bearing knee prostheses. We examined 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had a rotating platform total knee arthroplasty (NexGen LPS mobile, Zimmer Inc. Warsaw, USA). Fluoroscopic data was collected during a step-up motion six months postoperatively. A 3D\textendash 2D model fitting technique was used to reconstruct the in vivo 3D kinematics. The femoral component showed more axial rotation than the polyethylene mobile-bearing insert compared to the tibia during extension. In eight knees, the femoral component rotated internally with respect to the tibia during extension. In the other two knees the femoral component rotated externally with respect to the tibia. In all 10 patients, the femur showed more axial rotation than the mobile-bearing insert indicating the femoral component was sliding on the polyethylene of the rotating platform during the step-up motion. Possible explanations are a too limited conformity between femoral component and insert, the anterior located pivot location of the investigated rotating platform design, polyethylene on metal impingement and fibrous tissue formation between the mobile-bearing insert and the tibial plateau.},

A system of experimental methods, integrating the optical Contact Pressure Display (CPD) method for plantar pressure measurements and a Digital Radiographic Fluoroscopy (DRF) instrument for acquisition of skeletal motion during gait, was also developed in this study and subsequently used to build the foot model and validate its predictions. Using a Finite Element solver, the stress distribution within the foot structure was obtained and regions of elevated stresses for six subphases of the stance (initial-contact, heel-strike, midstance, forefoot-contact, push-off, and toe-off) were located. For each of these subphases, the model was adapted according to the corresponding fluoroscopic data, skeletal dynamics, and active muscle force loading. Validation of the stress state was achieved by comparing model predictions of contact stress distribution with respective CPD measurements. The presently developed measurement and numerical analysis tools open new approaches for clinical applications, from simulation of the development mechanisms of common foot disorders to pre- and post-interventional evaluation of their treatment.

Biomech. Eng. 105 (1983) 136). There is currently a lack of standard for reporting joint motion in the field of biomechanics for human movement, and the JCS as proposed by Grood and Suntay has the advantage of reporting joint motions in clinically relevant terms.  In this communication, the STC proposes definitions of JCS for the ankle, hip, and spine. Definitions for other joints (such as shoulder, elbow, hand and wrist, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and whole body) will be reported in later parts of the series. The STC is publishing these recommendations so as to encourage their use, to stimulate feedback and discussion, and to facilitate further revisions.  For each joint, a standard for the local axis system in each articulating bone is generated. These axes then standardize the JCS. Adopting these standards will lead to better communication among researchers and clinicians.},

  abstract = {Since 1990, the Standardization and Terminology Committee of the International Society of Biomechanics has been working towards a recommendation for standardization in the reporting of kinematic data. The paper, which is a result of those efforts (including broad input from members of the Society), is intended as a guide to the presentation of kinematic data in refereed publications and other materials. It is hoped that some uniformity in presentation will make publications easier to read and allow for the more straightforward comparison of data sets from different investigators. It is not intended to restrict individual investigators in the manner in which they collect or process their data. Rather, it could be viewed as a ``output filter'' applied to a variety of data formats to provide uniformity in the final product. The ISB is cognizant of the various attempts at standardization that are being pursued by other organizations-such as CAMARC in Europe, the Clinical Gait Laboratory Group in the U.S.A., and the efforts of individual professional groups such as the Scoliosis Research Society. Where possible, we have sought unanimity with these groups, but on issues where the members of our society expressed strong opinions, we have-at timesstated a contrary view. One example in point is the use of center of mass-based segmental reference frames. Since such reference frames are needed for conventional dynamic analysis, we make the recommendation that such frames should be routinely used. We anticipate that extension to the present document in the future will include recommendations for joint coordinate systems and the definition of anatomical landmarks for locating other segmental reference frames. The committee recognizes that standardization of the description of movement at individual joints is best left to those who are intimately involved in the study of those joints, and we have therefore appointed subcommittees for various joints to provide recommendations. Groups are currently active for the ankle, hand, shoulder, spine, temporomandibular joints, whole body and wrist; members with interests and explrtise in other joints are being actively sought. The initial recommendations of some of these groups have already been published in the ISB Newsletter, and once these recommendation have been discussed by the membership, a subsequent document on joint coordinate systems will be published. The present recommendations are presented as a framework on which future progress can be based. We are grateful to former members of the Standardization and Terminology Committee (notably Professors John Paul, David Winter, and Don Grieve) and to the many ISB members who have commented on earlier drafts of this recommendation. The present paper owes much to the work of Sommer (1991).},

  journal = {arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},
  abstract = {Marker-based optical motion capture (mocap) is the "gold standard" method for acquiring accurate 3D human motion in computer vision, medicine, and graphics. The raw output of these systems are noisy and incomplete 3D points or short tracklets of points. To be useful, one must associate these points with corresponding markers on the captured subject; i.e. "labelling". Given these labels, one can then "solve" for the 3D skeleton or body surface mesh. Commercial auto-labeling tools require a specific calibration procedure at capture time, which is not possible for archival data. Here we train a novel neural network called SOMA, which takes raw mocap point clouds with varying numbers of points, labels them at scale without any calibration data, independent of the capture technology, and requiring only minimal human intervention. Our key insight is that, while labeling point clouds is highly ambiguous, the 3D body provides strong constraints on the solution that can be exploited by a learning-based method. To enable learning, we generate massive training sets of simulated noisy and ground truth mocap markers animated by 3D bodies from AMASS. SOMA exploits an architecture with stacked self-attention elements to learn the spatial structure of the 3D body and an optimal transport layer to constrain the assignment (labeling) problem while rejecting outliers. We extensively evaluate SOMA both quantitatively and qualitatively. SOMA is more accurate and robust than existing state of the art research methods and can be applied where commercial systems cannot. We automatically label over 8 hours of archival mocap data across 4 different datasets captured using various technologies and output SMPL-X body models. The model and data is released for research purposes at https://soma.is.tue.mpg.de/.},

  abstract = {While measuring knee motion in all six degrees of freedom is important for understanding and treating orthopaedic knee pathologies, traditional motion capture techniques lack the required accuracy. A variety of model-based biplane fluoroscopy techniques have been developed with sub-millimeter accuracy. However, no studies have statistically evaluated the consistency of the accuracy across motions of varying intensity or between degrees of freedom. Therefore, this study evaluated the bias and precision of a contour-based tracking technique by comparing it to a marker-based method (gold standard) during three movements with increasing intensity. Six cadaveric knees with implanted tantalum markers were used to simulate knee extension, walking and drop landings, while motion was recorded by a custom biplane fluoroscopy system. The 3D geometries of the bones were reconstructed from CT scans and anatomical coordinate systems were assigned. The position and orientation of the bone and marker models were determined for an average of 27 frames for each trial and knee joint kinematics were compared. The average bias and precision was 0.0170.651 for rotations and 0.0170.59 mm for joint translations. Rotational precision was affected by motion (p{$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.04) and depended on the axis of rotation (p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.02). However, the difference in average precision among motions or axes was small (r0.131) and not likely of consequence for kinematic measurements. No other differences were found. The contour-based technique demonstrated sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy, indicating it is a highly accurate tool for measuring complex three dimensional knee movements of any intensity.},

Such methods employ black-box search algorithms over image transformations with continuous or discrete parameters and require a long time to obtain better strategies. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy search pipeline for data augmentation, which is much faster than previous methods. We introduce approximate gradients for several transformation operations with discrete parameters as well as the differentiable mechanism for selecting operations. As the objective of training, we minimize the distance between the distributions of augmented data and the original data, which can be differentiated. We show that our method, Faster AutoAugment, achieves significantly faster searching than prior work without a performance drop.},

The third is an algorithm to process estimation even when the silhouettes of two components overlap. To assess our algorithm's potential for clinical application, we carried out two experiments. First, we used a robot to position the prosthesis. Estimation accuracy was checked by comparing input data to the robot with the estimates from X-ray photographs. Incorporating our articulation model remarkably reduced the error in the depth translation.

  abstract = {Objective. A method has been developed to accurately measure three-dimensional (3-D) femoral-tibial contact positions of artificial knee implants in vivo from X-ray fluoroscopy images using interactive 3-D computer vision algorithms. Design. A computerized graphical (CAD) model of an implant component is displayed as an overlay on the original X-ray image. An image matching algorithm matches the silhouette of the implant component against a library of images, in order to estimate the position and orientation (pose) of the component. The operator further adjusts the pose of the graphical model to improve the accuracy of the match. Background. Previous methods for in vivo measurement of joint kinematics make only indirect measurements of joint kinematics, require invasive procedures such as markers or pins, or make simplifying assumptions about imaging geometry which can reduce the accuracy of the resulting measurements. Methods. Fluoroscopic videos are taken of implanted knees in subjects performing weight-bearing motion. Images from the videos are digitized and stored on a computer workstation. Using computerized model matching, the relative pose of the two knee implant components can be determined in each image. The resulting information can be used to determine where the two components are contacting, the area of the contact region, liftoff angle, and other kinematic data. Results. Accuracy tests done on simulated imagery and in vitro real imagery show that the pose estimation method is accurate to less than 0.5 mm of error (RMS) for translations parallel to the image plane. Orientation error is less than or equal to 0.35 \textdegree{} about any axis. Errors are larger for translations perpendicular to the image plane (up to 2.25 mm). In a clinical study, the method was used to measure in vivo contact points, and characterize the kinematic patterns of two different knee implant designs. Conclusions. The ability to accurately measure knee kinematics in vivo is critical for the understanding of the behavior of knee implant designs and the ultimate development of new, longer lasting implants.},

Previous morphological studies have not directly evaluated relationships between morphology and knee kinematics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between distal femur bony morphology and in vivo knee kinematics during running. It was hypothesized that the posterior offset of the transcondylar axis would be related to the magnitude of anterior/posterior tibio-femoral translation and that the rotational angle of the transcondylar axis would be related to the magnitude of internal/external knee rotation.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate tibiofemoral joint contact paths during a functional activity (running) and investigate the relationship between these arthrokinematic measures and traditional kinematics (internal/external rotation). Methods Tibio-femoral motion was assessed for the contralateral (uninjured) knees of 29 ACL-reconstructed individuals during downhill running, using dynamic stereo X-ray combined with three-dimensional CT bone models to produce knee kinematics and dynamic joint contact paths. The joint contact sliding length was estimated by comparing femoral and tibial contact paths. The difference in sliding length between compartments was compared to knee rotation. Results Sliding length was significantly larger on the medial side (10.2 {$\pm$} 3.8 mm) than the lateral side (2.3 {$\pm$} 4.0 mm). The difference in sliding length between compartments (mean 7.8 {$\pm$} 3.0 mm) was significantly correlated with internal tibial rotation (P \textbackslash{} 0.01, R2 = 0.74). Conclusion The relationship between rotational knee kinematics and joint contact paths was specifically revealed as greater tibial internal rotation was associated with larger magnitude of sliding motion in the medial compartment.},

  abstract = {Comprehending knee motion is an essential requirement for studying the causes of knee disorders. In this paper, we propose a new 2-D\textendash 3-D registration system based on jointconstraint model for reconstructing total knee motion. The proposed model that contains bone geometries and an articulated joint mechanism is first constructed from multipostural magnetic resonancevolumetric images. Then, the bone segments of the model are hierarchically registered to each frame of the given single-plane fluoroscopic video that records the knee activity. The bone posture is iteratively optimized using a modified chamfer matching algorithm to yield the simulated radiograph which is the best fit to the underlying fluoroscopic image. Unlike conventional registration methods computing posture parameters for each bone independently, the proposed femorotibial and patellofemoral joint models properly maintain the articulations between femur, tibia, and patella during the registration processes. As a result, we can obtain a sequence of registered knee postures showing smooth and reasonable physiologic patterns of motion. The proposed system also provides joint-space interpolation to densely generate intermediate postures for motion animation. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by computer simulation, animal cadaver, and in vivo knee testing. The mean target registration errors for femur, tibia, and patella were less than 1.5 mm. In particular, small out-of-plane registration errors [less than 1 mm (translation) and 2{$\smwhtcircle$} (rotation)] were achieved in animal cadaver assessments.},

Materials and methods In the preoperative stage, we construct a CT-like intensity atlas of the anatomy of interest. In the intraoperative stage, we deformably register this atlas to fluoroscopic X-ray images of the patient anatomy. We iteratively refine the atlas-to-patient registration by establishing explicit correspondences between bone surfaces in the atlas and their projections in the X-ray images. The advantage of our method is its use of CT-quality intensity data for correspondence establishment, which eliminates the edgedetection problem and diminishes the miscorrespondence problem. We validate our method on two datasets: (1) an in vitro dry femur; (2) Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs, which were generated from 17 clinical CTs, and simulate realistic in vivo femurs. Results The mean surface approximation error of our femur atlas was 0.85 {$\pm$} 0.16 mm. On Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs, the mean surface reconstruction error was 1.40 {$\pm$} 0.55 mm. On a dry femur, the mean surface reconstruction error was 1.44 mm. Conclusion The results show that our reconstruction method is on par with the state of the art in reconstruction of ex vivo femurs. In addition, the results demonstrate that our method is effective in realistic simulations of the in vivo scenario.},

Two micrometer-based in vitro phantom models of the skeletal segments in the hip and knee joints were used. The spatial positions of tantalum markers that were implanted into each skeletal segment were reconstructed using RSA. The position and orientation of each segment were determined in fluoroscopy images by minimizing the difference between the markers measured and projected in the image plane. Accuracy was determined in terms of bias and precision by analyzing the deviation between the applied displacement protocol and measured pose estimates. Measured translational accuracy was less than 100 mm parallel to the image plane and less than 700 mm in the direction orthogonal to the image plane. The measured rotational error was less than 11. Measured translational and rotational bias was not statistically significant at the 95\% level of confidence. The technique allows real-time kinematic skeletal measurements to be performed on human subjects implanted with tantalum markers for quantitatively measuring the motion of normal joints and different implant designs.},

Materials and methods: Ten subjects who were judged clinically successful after a posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty were analyzed under dynamic conditions using fluoroscopy, following a quantitative evaluation of coronal and sagittal laxity using Telos and KT-2000 arthrometers under static conditions. Results: Under static conditions, the anteroposterior laxity averaged 10.3 mm at 30\textdegree{} of flexion, and 8.3 mm at 75\textdegree. Abduction and adduction at full extension averaged 3.7 and 4.4 mm, respectively. Under dynamic conditions, 7/10 subjects demonstrated posterior femoral rollback of their lateral condyle moving from full extension to maximum knee flexion, and 8/10 experienced normal axial rotation patterns during deep knee bend activity. Furthermore, 7/10 subjects exhibited screw-home motion. 4/10 subjects experienced greater than 1.0 mm of condylar liftoff. Conclusion: We could not predict a consistent relationship between the laxity and kinematics. The activity of the muscles and ligamentous tension under dynamic conditions might have a much greater effect on the kinematics with currently used prosthetic designs than the laxity of ligamentous structures under static conditions.},

However, current methods of measuring TKA kinematics are too cumbersome or time-consuming for practical clinical application. Even stateof-the-art techniques require human-supervised initialization or human supervision throughout the entire optimization process. Elimination of human supervision could potentially bring this technology into clinical practicality. Therefore, we propose a fully autonomous pipeline for quantifying TKA kinematics from single-plane imaging. First, a convolutional neural network segments the femoral and tibial implants from the image. Second, segmented images are compared to Normalized Fourier Descriptor shape libraries for initial pose estimates. Lastly, a Lipschitzian optimization routine minimizes the difference between the segmented image and the projected implant. This technique reliably reproduces human-supervised kinematics measurements from internal datasets and external validation studies, with RMS differences of less than 0.7mm and 4\textdegree{} for internal studies and 0.8mm and 1.7\textdegree{} for external validation studies. This performance indicates that it will soon be practical to perform these measurements in a clinical setting.},

Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

The algorithm is a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function evaluations than most competing methods. The motivation for the new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants, and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast convergence of the new algorithm on the test functions.},

  abstract = {Background: Revisions and reoperations for patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA), unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), and distal femoral replacement (DFR) necessitates accurate identification of implant manufacturer and model. Failure risks delays in care, increased morbidity, and further financial burden. Deep learning permits automated image processing to mitigate the challenges behind expeditious, cost-effective preoperative planning. Our aim was to investigate whether a deeplearning algorithm could accurately identify the manufacturer and model of arthroplasty implants about the knee from plain radiographs. Methods: We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning algorithm to classify knee arthroplasty implants from one of 9 different implant models from retrospectively collected anteriorposterior (AP) plain radiographs from four sites in one quaternary referral health system. The performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when compared with a reference standard of implant model from operative reports. Results: The training and validation data sets were comprised of 682 radiographs across 424 patients and included a wide range of TKAs from the four leading implant manufacturers. After 1000 training epochs by the deep-learning algorithm, the model discriminated nine implant models with an AUC of 0.99, accuracy 99\%, sensitivity of 95\%, and specificity of 99\% in the external-testing data set of 74 radiographs. Conclusions: A deep learning algorithm using plain radiographs differentiated between 9 unique knee arthroplasty implants from four manufacturers with near-perfect accuracy. The iterative capability of the algorithm allows for scalable expansion of implant discriminations and represents an opportunity in delivering cost-effective care for revision arthroplasty.},

We hypothesized that rotating-platform knee replacements would exhibit greater rotation of the tibia relative to the fixed-bearing knee replacements. Materials and Methods: The in vivo motion of the tibia relative to the femur was measured in subjects with posterior stabilized fixed-bearing (FB) and rotating-platform (RP) total knee arthroplasties using a high-speed stereo radiography system during a lunge and gait with a change in direction (pivot). Results: The in vivo internal/external (IE) rotation and anterior/posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur was similar between mobile and fixed-bearing total knee prostheses during two activities of daily living that included an activity that challenged tibial IE rotation. Measurements of IE rotation in participants with RP had higher variability and significantly greater range between maximum internal and external rotation compared with FB participants. The greater amount of variability of RP was not unlike the healthy knee. Conclusion: The pattern of IE rotation and AP translation for both RP and FB designs were similar to healthy kinematics but with less IE rotation. The RP implants more closely replicated the asymmetrical posterior condylar translation and range of IE rotation of the healthy knee during activity that challenged tibial IE rotation.},

In particular, PoseNet [22] is a deep convolutional neural network which learns to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single image. It learns to localize using high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and unknown camera intrinsics, where point based SIFT registration fails. However, it was trained using a naive loss function, with hyper-parameters which require expensive tuning. In this paper, we give the problem a more fundamental theoretical treatment. We explore a number of novel loss functions for learning camera pose which are based on geometry and scene reprojection error. Additionally we show how to automatically learn an optimal weighting to simultaneously regress position and orientation. By leveraging geometry, we demonstrate that our technique significantly improves PoseNet's performance across datasets ranging from indoor rooms to a small city.},

  abstract = {Analyzing knee kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been attracting considerable attentions because the knee kinematics can be used to evaluate TKA patients and to evaluate TKA operations and design of knee implants. Knee kinematics can be estimated by 2-D/3-D image registration from 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) models of knee implants to 2-D X-ray image. Although there are many studies for estimating knee kinematics, they have common problems that are dependency on initial pose/position and falling into local maxima. This study proposes a robust 2-D/3-D image registration method based on evolutional computing. The evolutional computing has both characteristics of global search performance and of local search performance. The characteristics are suitable for solving the problems of 2-D/3-D image registration. The proposed system has been evaluated by applying it to computer-synthesized images, X-ray images of phantoms, and X-ray images of TKA patients.},

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of WB on in vivo kinematics of mobilebearing UKA during high knee flexion activities. Methods\hspace{0.6em} The kinematics of UKA were evaluated under fluoroscopy during squatting (WB) and active-assisted knee flexion (non-weight bearing, NWB). Range of motion, femoral axis rotation relative to the tibia, anteroposterior (AP) translation of the medial and lateral sides, and kinematic pathway were measured. Results\hspace{0.6em} There were no differences in knee flexion range and external rotation of the femur in each flexion angle between the WB conditions. The amount of femoral external rotation between minimum flexion and 60\textdegree{} of flexion during WB was significantly larger than that during NWB, and that between 60\textdegree{} and 130\textdegree{} of flexion during NWB was significantly larger than that during WB. There were no differences in medial AP translation of the femur in each flexion angle between the WB conditions. However, on the lateral side, posterior translation of 52.9\,{$\pm$}\,12.7\% was observed between minimum flexion and 130\textdegree{} of flexion during WB. During NWB, there was no significant translation between minimum flexion and 60\textdegree{} of flexion; beyond 60\textdegree{} of flexion, posterior translation was 41.6\,{$\pm$}\,8.7\%. Between 20\textdegree{} and 80\textdegree{} of flexion, the lateral side in WB was located more posteriorly than in NWB (p\,{$<$}\,0.05).

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the dynamic knee motion in-vivo is instrumental for understanding normal and pathological function of the knee joint. However, interpreting motion of the knee joint during gait in other than the sagittal plane remains controversial. In this study, we utilized the dual fluoroscopic imaging technique to investigate the six-degree-of-freedom kinematics and condylar motion of the knee during the stance phase of treadmill gait in eight healthy volunteers at a speed of 0.67 m/s. We hypothesized that the 6DOF knee kinematics measured during gait will be different from those reported for non-weightbearing activities, especially with regards to the phenomenon of femoral rollback. In addition, we hypothesized that motion of the medial femoral condyle in the transverse plane is greater than that of the lateral femoral condyle during the stance phase of treadmill gait. The rotational motion and the anterior\textendash posterior translation of the femur with respect to the tibia showed a clear relationship with the flexion\textendash extension path of the knee during the stance phase. Additionally, we observed that the phenomenon of femoral rollback was reversed, with the femur noted to move posteriorly with extension and anteriorly with flexion. Furthermore, we noted that motion of the medial femoral condyle in the transverse plane was greater than that of the lateral femoral condyle during the stance phase of gait (17.472.0 mm vs. 7.476.1 mm, respectively; po0.01). The trend was opposite to what has been observed during non-weightbearing flexion or single-leg lunge in previous studies. These data provide baseline knowledge for the understanding of normal physiology and for the analysis of pathological function of the knee joint during walking. These findings further demonstrate that knee kinematics is activity-dependent and motion patterns of one activity (non-weightbearing flexion or lunge) cannot be generalized to interpret a different one (gait).},

This relationship is used for object recognition and positioning. Object models consist of collections of parametric surface patches and their intersection curves; this includes nearly all representations used in computer-aided geometric design and computer vision. The image contours considered are the projections of surface discontinuities and occluding contours. Elimination theory provides a method for constructing the implicit equation of these contours for an object observed under orthographic or perspective projection. This equation is parameterized by the object's position and orientation with respect to the observer. Determining these parameters is reduced to a fitting problem between the theoretical contour and the observed data points. The proposed approach readily extends to parameterized models. It has been implemented for a simple world composed of various surfaces of revolution and tested on several real images. {$>$}},

  abstract = {The current study aimed to quantify the soft tissue artifacts of selected markers on the thigh and shank, and their effects on the calculated joint center translations, angles and moments of the knee during sitto-stand. Ten patients with total knee replacements rose from a chair under simultaneous surveillance of a motion capture system, a force-plate and a fluoroscopy system. The ``true'' poses of the thigh and shank were defined by those of the femoral and tibial components obtained using a three-dimensional fluoroscopy method. The soft tissue artifacts of the skin markers were calculated as their movement relative to the underlying prosthesis components. The joint center translations, angles and moments at the knee were also calculated separately using skin markers and the registered prosthesis poses. Considerable soft tissue artifacts were found, leading to significantly underestimated flexion and internal rotation angles, and extensor moments, but overestimated joint center translations and adduction. The current study provides accurate data of the kinematics and kinetics of total knee replacements during sit-to-stand. The effects of soft tissue artifacts on the calculated joint center translations, angles and moments were also quantified for the first time in the literature. The results may help in developing guidelines for using skin markers and in establishing databases in the biomechanical assessment of sit-to-stand in patients with total knee replacements.},

The purpose of this study was to formulate projections for the number of primary and revision total hip and knee arthroplasties that will be performed in the United States through 2030. Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1990 to 2003) was used in conjunction with United States Census Bureau data to quantify primary and revision arthroplasty rates as a function of age, gender, race and/or ethnicity, and census region. Projections were performed with use of Poisson regression on historical procedure rates in combination with population projections from 2005 to 2030. Results: By 2030, the demand for primary total hip arthroplasties is estimated to grow by 174\% to 572,000. The demand for primary total knee arthroplasties is projected to grow by 673\% to 3.48 million procedures. The demand for hip revision procedures is projected to double by the year 2026, while the demand for knee revisions is expected to double by 2015. Although hip revisions are currently more frequently performed than knee revisions, the demand for knee revisions is expected to surpass the demand for hip revisions after 2007. Overall, total hip and total knee revisions are projected to grow by 137\% and 601\%, respectively, between 2005 and 2030. Conclusions: These large projected increases in demand for total hip and knee arthroplasties provide a quantitative basis for future policy decisions related to the numbers of orthopaedic surgeons needed to perform these procedures and the deployment of appropriate resources to serve this need.},

Target markers were fixed to tibia and femur by means of intra-cortical traction pins. Radiographs of the lower limb were obtained to compute the position of the target markers relative to internal anatomical structures. High-speed cine cameras were used to measure three-dimensional coordinates of the target markers in five subjects walking at a speed of 1.2 m s-1. Relative motion between tibia and femur was resolved according to a joint coordinate system (JCS). The measurements have identified that substantial angular and linear motions occur about and along each of the JCS axes during walking. The results do not, however, support the traditional view that the so-called `screw home' mechanism of the knee joint operates during gait.},

  abstract = {Background: Quantifying the effects of anterior cruciate ligament deficiency on joint biomechanics is critical in order to better understand the mechanisms of joint degeneration in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees and to improve the surgical treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. We investigated the changes in position of the in vivo tibiofemoral articular cartilage contact points in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient and intact contralateral knees with use of a newly developed dual orthogonal fluoroscopic and magnetic resonance imaging technique. Methods: Nine patients with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture in one knee and a normal contralateral knee were recruited. Magnetic resonance images were acquired for both the intact and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees to construct computer knee models of the surfaces of the bone and cartilage. Each patient performed a singleleg weight-bearing lunge as images were recorded with use of a dual fluoroscopic system at full extension and at 15\textdegree, 30\textdegree, 60\textdegree, and 90\textdegree{} of flexion. The in vivo knee position at each flexion angle was then reproduced with use of the knee models and fluoroscopic images. The contact points were defined as the centroids of the areas of intersection of the tibial and femoral articular cartilage surfaces. Results: The contact points moved not only in the anteroposterior direction but also in the mediolateral direction in both the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient and intact knees. In the anteroposterior direction, the contact points in the medial compartment of the tibia were more posterior in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees than in the intact knees at full extension and 15\textdegree{} of flexion (p {$<$} 0.05). No significant differences were observed with regard to the anteroposterior motion of the contact points in the lateral compartment of the tibia. In the mediolateral direction, there was a significant lateral shift of the contact points in the medial compartment of the tibia toward the medial tibial spine between full extension and 60\textdegree{} of flexion (p {$<$} 0.05). The contact points in the lateral compartment of the tibia shifted laterally, away from the lateral tibial spine, at 15\textdegree{} and 30\textdegree{} of flexion (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: In the presence of anterior cruciate ligament injury, the contact points shift both posteriorly and laterally on the surface of the tibial plateau. In the medial compartment, the contact points shift toward the medial tibial spine, a region where degeneration is observed in patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament injuries.},

The current study aimed to compare the STA and their effects on the kinematics of the knee between twelve patients with TKR and twelve healthy controls during sit-to-stand, and to assess the effects of STA on the statistical betweengroup comparisons. Each subject performed the sit-to-stand task while motions of the skin markers and the knees were measured by a motion capture system integrated with a three-dimensional fluoroscopy technique. The bone motions measured by the three-dimensional fluoroscopy were taken as the gold standard, with respect to which the STA of the markers were obtained. The STA were found to affect the calculated segmental poses and knee kinematics between the groups differently. The STA resulted in artefactual posterior displacements of the knee joint center, with magnitudes significantly greater in TKR than controls (p {$<$} 0.01). The STA-induced knee external rotations in TKR were smaller than those in controls with mean differences of 2.3\textendash 3.08. These between-group differences in the STA effects on knee kinematics in turn concealed the true between-group differences in the anterior\textendash posterior translation and internal/external rotation of knee while leading to false significant between-group differences in the abduction/adduction and proximal\textendash distal translation.},

The method is noninvasive, anatomybased, requires simple user interaction, and includes validation. It is generic and easily customizable for a variety of routine clinical uses in orthopaedic surgery. Gradient-based registration consists of three steps: 1) initial pose estimation; 2) coarse geometry-based registration on bone contours, and; 3) fine gradient projection registration (GPR) on edge pixels. It optimizes speed, accuracy, and robustness. Its novelty resides in using volume gradients to eliminate outliers and foreign objects in the fluoroscopic X-ray images, in speeding up computation, and in achieving higher accuracy. It overcomes the drawbacks of intensity-based methods, which are slow and have a limited convergence range, and of geometry-based methods, which depend on the image segmentation quality. Our simulated, in vitro, and cadaver experiments on a human pelvis CT, dry vertebra, dry femur, fresh lamb hip, and human pelvis under realistic conditions show a mean 0.5\textendash 1.7 mm (0.5\textendash 2.6 mm maximum) target registration accuracy.},

Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods.

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

Of these patients, 64 completed a minimum one year follow-u\- p. Patients completed full-f\-lexion kneeling while being imaged using single-\-plane fluoroscopy. Kinematics were calculated by registering the 3D implant models onto 2D-d\- ynamic fluoroscopic images and exported for analysis. Results CR-\-FB designs had significantly lower maximal flexion (mean 116\textdegree{} (SD 2.1\textdegree )) compared to CR-\-RP (123\textdegree{} (SD 1.6\textdegree )) and PS-F\- B (125\textdegree{} (SD 2.1\textdegree )). The PS-F\- B design displayed a more posteriorly positioned femur throughout flexion. Furthermore, the CR-R\- P femur was more externally rotated throughout kneeling. Finally, individual patient kinematics showed high degrees of variability within all designs. Conclusion The increased maximal flexion found in the PS-F\- B and CR-R\- P designs were likely achieved in different ways. The PS-F\- B design uses a cam-p\- ost to hold the femur more posteriorly preventing posterior impingement. The external rotation within the CR-R\- P design was surprising and hasn't previously been reported. It is likely due to the polyethylene bearing being decoupled from flexion. The findings of this study provide insights into the function of different knee arthroplasty designs in the context during deep kneeling and provide clinicians with a more kinematically informed choice for implant selection and may allow improved management of patients' functional expectations.},

While it is widely believed that abnormal patellar tracking plays a role in the development of patellofemoral pain syndrome, this link has not been established. The purpose of this cross-sectional case-control study was to test the hypothesis that patterns of patellar spin, tilt, and lateral translation make it possible to distinguish individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome and clinical evidence of patellar malalignment from those with patellofemoral pain syndrome and no clinical evidence of malalignment and from individuals with no knee problems. Methods: Three-dimensional patellofemoral joint kinematics in one knee of each of sixty volunteers (twenty in each group described above) were assessed with use of a new, validated magnetic resonance imaging-based method. Static low-resolution scans of the loaded knee were acquired at five different angles of knee flexion (ranging between -4\textdegree{} and 60\textdegree ). High-resolution geometric models of the patella, femur, and tibia and associated coordinate axes were registered to the bone positions on the low-resolution scans to determine the patellar motion as a function of knee flexion angle. Hierarchical modeling was used to identify group differences in patterns of patellar spin, tilt, and lateral translation. Results: No differences in the overall pattern of patellar motion were observed among groups (p {$>$} 0.08 for all global maximum likelihood ratio tests). Features of patellar spin and tilt patterns varied greatly between subjects across all three groups, and no significant group differences were detected. At 19\textdegree{} of knee flexion, the patellae in the group with patellofemoral pain and clinical evidence of malalignment were positioned an average of 2.25 mm more laterally than the patellae in the control group, and this difference was marginally significant (p = 0.049). Other features of the pattern of lateral translation did not differ, and large overlaps in values were observed across all groups. Conclusions: It cannot be determined from our cross-sectional study whether the more lateral position of the patella in the group with clinical evidence of malalignment preceded or followed the onset of symptoms. It is clear from the data that an individual with patellofemoral pain syndrome cannot be distinguished from a control subject by examining patterns of spin, tilt, or lateral translation of the patella, even when clinical evidence of mechanical abnormality was observed.},

If the geometry of the object is known, as well as the details of the image formation process, then the pose of the object with respect to the sensor can be determined. A common method for 3D-to-2D registration is to first segment the silhouette contour from the X-ray image; that is, identify all points in the image that belong to the 2D silhouette and not to the background. This segmentation step is then followed by a search for the 3D pose that will best match the observed contour with a predicted contour.},

  abstract = {A method was developed for registering three-dimensional knee implant models to single plane X-ray fluoroscopy images. We use a direct image-to-image similarity measure, taking advantage of the speed of modern computer graphics workstations to quickly render simulated (predicted) images. As a result, the method does not require an accurate segmentation of the implant silhouette in the image (which can be prone to errors). A robust optimization algorithm (simulated annealing) is used that can escape local minima and find the global minimum (true solution). Although we focus on the analysis of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in this paper, the method can be (and has been) applied to other implanted joints, including, but not limited to, hips, ankles, and temporomandibular joints. Convergence tests on an in vivo image show that the registration method can reliably find poses that are very close to the optimal (i.e., within 0.4 and 0.1 mm), even from starting poses with large initial errors. However, the precision of translation measurement in the (out-of-plane) direction is not as good. We also show that the method is robust with respect to image noise and occlusions. However, a small amount of user supervision and intervention is necessary to detect cases when the optimization algorithm falls into a local minimum. Intervention is required less than 5\% of the time when the initial starting pose is reasonably close to the correct answer, but up to 50\% of the time when the initial starting pose is far away. Finally, extensive evaluations were performed on cadaver images to determine accuracy of relative pose measurement. Comparing against data derived from an optical sensor as a ``gold standard,'' the overall rootmean-square error of the registration method was approximately 1.5 and 0.65 mm (although translation error was higher). However, uncertainty in the optical sensor data may account for a large part of the observed error.},

  abstract = {Background: Descriptive epidemiology of total joint replacement procedures is limited to annual procedure volumes (incidence). The prevalence of the growing number of individuals living with a total hip or total knee replacement is currently unknown. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of total hip and total knee replacement in the United States. Methods: Prevalence was estimated using the counting method by combining historical incidence data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases from 1969 to 2010 with general population census and mortality counts. We accounted for relative differences in mortality rates between those who have had total hip or knee replacement and the general population. Results: The 2010 prevalence of total hip and total knee replacement in the total U.S. population was 0.83\% and 1.52\%, respectively. Prevalence was higher among women than among men and increased with age, reaching 5.26\% for total hip replacement and 10.38\% for total knee replacement at eighty years. These estimates corresponded to 2.5 million individuals (1.4 million women and 1.1 million men) with total hip replacement and 4.7 million individuals (3.0 million women and 1.7 million men) with total knee replacement in 2010. Secular trends indicated a substantial rise in prevalence over time and a shift to younger ages. Conclusions: Around 7 million Americans are living with a hip or knee replacement, and consequently, in most cases, are mobile, despite advanced arthritis. These numbers underscore the substantial public health impact of total hip and knee arthroplasties.},

The tests require novel statistical and geometrical analyses of the Procrustes shape manifold. For describing components of symmetry and asymmetry within samples, an extension of principal component analysis is introduced and illustrated by appropriate deformation techniques.

A human pendulum was used to deliver controlled impacts to the right foot of 21 subjects for three IKA (0, 20 and 40\textdegree ) and three interfaces (barefoot, soft and hard EVA foams). The external impact force and the shock experienced by the subjects' shank were measured simultaneously with a wall mounted force platform and a skin mounted accelerometer, respectively. Stiffness of the leg was derived using impact velocity and wall reaction force data. The results disproved the role of the knee joint in regulating initial leg stiffness and provided only partial support for the hypothesized improved cushioning. Larger knee flexion at contact reduced impact force but increased the shock travelling throughout the shank. Conversely, softer interfaces produced sizable reductions in both initial leg stiffness and severity of the impact experienced by the lower limb. Force rate of loading was found to be highly correlated ( r =0.95) to limb stiffness that was defined by the heel fat pad and interface deformations. These results would suggest that interface interventions are more likely to protect the locomotor system against impact loading than knee angle strategies.},

Steinmann traction pins were inserted into the right tibia and femur of five adult men who had apparently normal lower extremities. Target clusters mounted onto the pins were filmed by four cine cameras operating at 100 frames/sec. Two trials per subject were analyzed for each of the three experimental conditions: regular running shoes, running shoes with a 10\textdegree{} valgus wedge, and running shoes with a 10\textdegree{} varus wedge. The different types of footwear induced only minor kinematic changes at the knee during the stance phase of walking. The angular patterns of the tibiofemoral joint were modified by less than 1\textdegree, whereas the translatory patterns were altered by 2 mm. Immediately following foot-strike, the valgus-wedge shoes caused the tibia to rotate internally 4\textdegree{} more than the varus-wedge shoes, but at the tibiofemoral joint no consistent differences in the pattern of internal-external rotation between normal and modified footwear were measurable. These findings suggest that, in the healthy lower extremity, increased internal and external tibial rotation is resolved at the hip joint, with changes at the tibiofemoral joint that barely are detectable with the techniques used in this study.},

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\$\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\$-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum's area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process.},

  title = {Early Processing of Visual Information},
  author = {Marr, D.},
  year = {1976},
  abstract = {An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define 'placetokens' in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that 'non-attentive' vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down.},

  abstract = {A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of {$\nabla$} 2  G(x, y) *  I(x, y)  for image I, where  G(x, y)  is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and {$\nabla$} 2  is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround {$\nabla$} 2  G  filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr \& Ullman 1979).},

IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 14, 239\textendash 256.] for calculating the transformation parameters for a rigid body undergoing planar motion parallel to the image plane. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by estimating the finite centre of rotation and angle of rotation from lateral flexion/extension radiographs of the lumbar spine. In an in vitro error study, the method displayed an average error of rotation of 0:44 \AE{} 0:45 , and an average error in FCR calculation of 7:6 \AE{} 8:5 mm. The method was shown to be superior to that of Crisco et al. [Two-dimensional rigid-body kinematics using image contour registration. Journal of Biomechanics 28(1), 119\textendash 124.] and Brinckmann et al. [Quantification of overload injuries of the thoracolumbar spine in persons exposed to heavy physical exertions or vibration at the workplace: Part i\textemdash the shape of vertebrae and intervertebral discs\textemdash study of a yound, healthy population and a middle-aged control group. Clinical Biomechanics Supplement 1, S5\textendash S83.] for the tests performed here. In general, we believe the use of splines to represent planar shapes to be superior to using digitised curves or landmarks for several reasons. First, with appropriate software, splines require less effort to define and are a compact representation, with most vertebra outlines using less than 30 control points. Second, splines are inherently sub-pixel representations of curves, even if the control points are limited to pixel resolutions. Third, there is a well-defined method (the ICP algorithm) for registering shapes represented as splines. Finally, like digitised curves, splines are able to represent a large class of shapes with little effort, but reduce potential segmentation errors from two dimensions (parallel and perpendicular to the image gradient) to just one (parallel to the image gradient). We have developed an application for performing all the necessary computations which can be downloaded from http://www.claritysmart.com.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previous research has quantified cervical spine motion with conventional measurement techniques (eg, cadaveric studies, motion capture systems, and fluoroscopy), but these techniques were not designed to accurately measure three-dimensional (3D) dynamic cervical spine motion under in vivo conditions. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to characterize the accuracy of model-based tracking for measuring 3D dynamic cervical spine kinematics and to demonstrate its in vivo application. STUDY DESIGN: Through accuracy assessment and application of technique, in vivo cervical spine motion was measured. METHODS: The accuracy of model-based tracking for measuring cervical spine motion was determined in an in vitro experiment. Tantalum beads were implanted into the vertebrae of an ovine specimen, and biplane X-ray images were acquired as the specimen's neck was manually moved through neck extension and axial neck rotation. The 3D position and orientation of each cervical vertebra were determined from the biplane X-ray images using model-based tracking. For comparison, the position and orientation of each vertebra were also determined by tracking the position of the implanted beads with dynamic radiostereometric analysis. To demonstrate in vivo application of this technique, biplane X-ray images were acquired as a human subject performed two motion tasks: neck extension and axial neck rotation. The positions and orientations of each cervical vertebra were determined with model-based tracking. Cervical spine motion was reported with standard kinematic descriptions of translation and rotation. RESULTS: The in vitro validation demonstrated that model-based tracking is accurate to within 60.6 mm and 60.6  for measuring cervical spine motion. For the in vivo application, there were significant rotations about all three anatomical axes for both the neck extension and axial neck rotation motion tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Model-based tracking is an accurate technique for measuring in vivo, 3D, dynamic cervical spine motion. Preliminary data acquired using this technique are in agreement with previous studies. It is anticipated that this experimental approach will enhance our understanding of cervical spine motion under normal and pathologic conditions. \'O 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Our previous efforts have been focused on determining the in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) kinematics of the normal and abnormal carpus. In so doing we have developed an extensive database of carpal bone anatomy and kinematics from a large number of healthy subjects. The purpose of this paper is to describe that database and to make it available to other researchers. CT volume images of both wrists from 30 healthy volunteers (15 males and 15 females) were acquired in multiple wrist positions throughout the normal range of wrist motion. The outer cortical surfaces of the carpal bones, radius and ulna, and proximal metacarpals were segmented and the 3-D motion of each bone was calculated for each wrist position. The database was constructed to include high-resolution surface models, measures of bone volume and shape, and the 3-D kinematics of each segmented bone. The database does not include soft tissues of the wrist. While there are numerous digital anatomical databases, this one is unique in that it includes a large number of subjects and it contains in vivo kinematic data as well as the bony anatomy.},

The lack of such information for the elbow has motivated the present study. An attempt is therefore made to measure the rotatory component of cadaver elbows under passive motion. The results obtained will be used to Justify certain noninvasive means to measure three-dimensional angular motion for hving subjects. Using biplanar radiographs, cadaver forearms were studied under the passive motions of flexion-extensIOn and supination-pronation. The coordmate axes for the forearm, radius and ulna were defined based on imbedded Kirschner wires The three-dimensional rotation of the forearm with respect to the humerus, as well as the relative motion among the radius, ulna and humerus, were analyzed based on Eulerian angles. The relationship between the primary modes of motion and the inherent secondary motion was defined and analyzed. No translatIOnal motion within the joint was considered because of the tight constraint of the ligamentous structure. However, this hypothesis was exammed by momtoring the vanation of the displacement of the moving coordmate center The implications of these findings to the surgical treatment of elbow problems were speculated on.},

Previous investigators have used custom-built biplane fluoroscopes designed specifically for kinematic applications, which are available at few institutions and require FDA approval prior to clinical use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of an off-the-shelf clinical biplane fluoroscope for kinematic applications by validating model-based tracking for measurement of glenohumeral motion using an unmodified clinical system. Biplane images of each shoulder of a cadaver torso were acquired at various joint positions and during simulated movements along anatomical planes of motion. The pose of each humerus and scapula was determined using model-based tracking and compared to a bead-based gold standard. Error due to a temporal-offset between corresponding biplane images, characteristic of clinical biplane systems, was determined by comparison of measured and known relative position of 2 bead clusters of a phantom that was imaged while moved throughout the fluoroscopy image volume. Model-based tracking had global kinematic mean absolute errors of 0.27 mm and 0.29\textdegree{} (static), and 0.22\textendash 0.32 mm and 0.12\textendash 0.45\textdegree{} (dynamic).

The temporal-offset was predicted to add errors of 0.06\textendash 0.85 mm and 0.05\textendash 0.28\textdegree{} for cadaveric trials for the speeds examined. For defined speeds, sub-millimeter and sub-degree kinematic accuracy and precision were achieved using an unmodified clinical biplane fluoroscope for quantification of glenohumeral motion.},

  abstract = {Background: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has been well defined as the main passive restraint to anterior tibial translation (ATT) in the knee and plays an important role in rotational stability. However, it is unknown how closely the ACL and other passive and active structures of the knee constrain translations and rotations across a set of functional activities of increasing demand on the quadriceps. Hypothesis: Anterior tibial translation and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur would increase as the demand on the quadriceps increased. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The in vivo 3-dimensional knee kinematics of 10 adult female patients (height, 167.8 6 7.1 cm; body mass, 57 6 4 kg; body mass index [BMI], 24.8 6 1.7 kg/m2; age, 29.7 6 7.9 years) was measured using biplane fluoroscopy while patients completed 4 functional tasks. The tasks included an unloaded knee extension in which the patient slowly extended the knee from 90\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree{} of flexion in 2 seconds; walking at a constant pace of 90 steps per minute; a maximum effort isometric knee extension with the knee at 70\textdegree{} of flexion; and landing from a height of 40 cm in which the patient stepped off a box, landed, and immediately performed a maximum effort vertical jump. Results: Landing (5.6 6 1.9 mm) produced significantly greater peak ATT than walking (3.1 6 2.2 mm) and unweighted full extension (2.6 6 2.1 mm) (P \textbackslash{} .01), but there was no difference between landing and a maximum isometric contraction (5.0 6 1.9 mm). While there was no significant difference in peak internal rotation between landing (19.4\textdegree{} 6 5.7\textdegree ), maximum isometric contraction (15.9\textdegree{} 6 6.7\textdegree ), and unweighted full knee extension (14.5\textdegree{} 6 7.7\textdegree ), each produced significantly greater internal rotation than walking (3.9\textdegree{} 6 4.2\textdegree ) (P \textbackslash{} .001). Knee extension torque significantly increased for each task (P \textbackslash{} .01): unweighted knee extension (4.7 6 1.2 N\'Am), walking (36.5 6 7.9 N\'Am), maximum isometric knee extension (105.1 6 8.2 N\'Am), and landing (140.2 6 26.2 N\'Am). Conclusion: Anterior tibial translations significantly increased as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increased. Internal rotation was not significantly different between landing, isometric contraction, and unweighted knee extension. Additionally, ATT and internal rotation from each motion were within the normal range, and no excessive amounts of translation or rotation were observed. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrated that while ATT will increase as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increases, the knee is able to effectively constrain ATT and internal rotation. This suggests that the healthy knee has a safe envelope of function that is tightly controlled even though task demand is elevated.},

The primary objectives were to introduce a new method for determining the optimal baseplate orientation to minimize bias error during MBRSA and to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the method using a knee positioning guide to repeatably orient the baseplate. A tibia phantom was rotated to achieve 24 different orientations with three pairs of radiographs acquired at each orientation. Radiographs were processed in MBRSA software and the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM), an indicator of bias error during model registration, was plotted as a function of the rotation angles to determine the optimal orientation and a range of acceptable orientations. The bias error decreased 85\% between the reference orientation and the optimal orientation. An acceptable range of orientations was defined by a decrease in bias error more than 50\%. Future researchers can use this method to determine the optimal orientation and a range of acceptable orientations for their specific baseplate to minimize bias error. Clinical usefulness was demonstrated by repeatedly imaging a knee model placed in a knee positioning guide (simulated clinical positioning) and demonstrating that the mean orientation {$\pm$} one standard deviation fell within the acceptable range of orientations. Thus, use of a knee positioning guide was an effective tool for repeatable patient positioning and should be considered for future RSA studies to maintain consistent positioning during a longitudinal study.},

Ten patients with bilateral total knee arthroplasty of 2 types were studied during weight-bearing lunge, kneeling, and stair activities using fluoroscopic imaging. There were no differences in maximum knee flexion during lunging or kneeling. Statistically significant differences in tibial rotation and condylar translation were observed during the 3 activities. Although several joint kinematic differences were observed, no important functional differences were observed in clinically excellent, high performing subjects with bilateral total knee arthroplasty of 2 types.

The purpose of this study was to assess the current trends and use of rTSA, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), and hemiarthroplasty (HA) from 2011 to 2014. Shoulder arthroplasty data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample database were analyzed for the years 2011 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. For each procedure, use and patient and hospital characteristics were identified. Shoulder arthroplasties increased by 24\% between 2011 and 2014, to 79,105 procedures. The proportion of arthroplasties that were aTSA did not change substantially (44\% for both years; P=.0585), while the proportion that were rTSA surpassed aTSA in 2014, increasing from 33\% to 46\% (P{$<$}.0001). Use of rTSA topped use of aTSA by 2013 for Medicare patients. The proportion that were HA procedures declined from 23\% to 11\% (P{$<$}.0001). The use of rTSA for fracture increased from 26\% to 58\% (P{$<$}.0001) of all arthroplasties for this indication, while the use of HA for fracture decreased from 69\% to 40\% (P{$<$}.0001). Orthopedists performed rTSA more often than aTSA for Medicare patients by 2013 and the general population by 2014. The use of rTSA for fracture has grown significantly, with rTSA being performed more frequently than HA for this indication. [Orthopedics. 2018; 41(3):e416\textendash e423.]},

  abstract = {Abnormal sagittal kinematics after total knee replacement (TKR) can adversely affect functional outcome. Two important determinants of knee kinematics are component geometry and the presence or absence of a posterior-stabilising mechanism (cam-post). We investigated the influence of these variables by comparing the kinematics of a TKR with a polyradial femur with a single radius design, both with and without a cam-post mechanism.             We assessed 55 patients, subdivided into four groups, who had undergone a TKR one year earlier by using an established fluoroscopy protocol in order to examine their kinematics in vivo. The kinematic profile was obtained by measuring the patellar tendon angle through the functional knee flexion range (0\textdegree{} to 90\textdegree ) and the results compared with 14 normal knees. All designs of TKR had abnormal sagittal kinematics compared with the normal knee. There was a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) difference between those of the two TKRs near to full extension. The presence of the cam-post mechanism did not influence the kinematics for either TKR design. These differences suggest that surface geometry is a stronger determinant of kinematics than the presence or absence of a cam-post mechanism for these two designs. This may be because the cam-post mechanism is ineffective.},

Most commonly, a single-plane fluoroscopic setup is used to capture the motion of prostheses during a particular task. Unfortunately, single-plane fluoroscopic analysis is imprecise in the out-of-plane direction. This can result in reconstructing physically impossible poses, in which\textemdash for example\textemdash the femoral component intersects with the insert, as the normal pose estimation process does not take into account the relation between the components. In the proposed method, the poses of both components are estimated simultaneously, while preventing femur\textendash insert collisions. In a phantom study, the accuracy and precision of the new method in estimating the relative pose of the femoral component were compared to those of the original method. With reverse engineered models, the errors in estimating the out-of-plane position decreased from 2.0 7 0.7 to 0.1 7 0.1 mm, without effects on the errors in rotations and the in-plane positions. With CAD models, the errors in estimating the out-ofplane position decreased from 5.3 70.7 mm (mean 7 SD) to 0.0 7 0.4 mm, at the expense of a decreased precision for the other position or orientation parameters. In conclusion, collision detection can prevent reconstructing impossible poses and it improves the position and motion estimation in the out-of-plane direction.},

The model-based approach, which does not require these markers, is, however, less precise. One of the reasons may be the fact that the spherical head has not been modelled. Therefore, we added a 3D surface model of the spherical head and estimated the position and orientation of the combined stem\textendash head model. The new method using a combined stem\textendash head model was compared in a phantom study on five prostheses (of different types) and in a clinical study using double examinations of implanted hip prostheses, with two existing methods: a standard model-based approach and one using elementary geometrical shapes. The combined model showed the highest precision for the rotation about the longitudinal axis in the phantom experiments. With a standard deviation of 0.691 it showed a significant improvement (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02) over the model-based approach (0.961) on the phantom data, but no improvement on the clinical data. Overall, the use of elementary geometrical shapes was worse with respect to the modelbased approach, with a standard deviation of 1.021 on the phantom data and 0.791 on the clinical data. This decrease in precision was significant (po0.01) on the clinical data. With relatively small differences in the other migration directions, these results demonstrate that the new method with a combined stem\textendash head model can be a useful alternative to the standard model-based approach.},

However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.},

Specifically, to activate the transformer's strong capability in representing features, we develop a new variant of a multi-head self-attention structure to enhance both point-wise and channel-wise relations of the feature map. In addition, we leverage a positional fusion block to comprehensively capture the local context of point cloud data, providing more position-related information about the scattered points.

Femorotibial contact positions for 40 patients implanted with either a fixed-bearing or mobile-bearing prosthesis were analyzed using videofluoroscopy. Femorotibial contact paths were determined using a computer automated model-fitting technique. Nineteen of 20 patients in each group experienced posterior femoral rollback of their lateral condyles, with a mean of 3.6 and 3.7 mm for fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing prostheses respectively. Eighteen patients who had mobile-bearing prostheses and 17 patients with fixed-bearing knee prostheses experienced a normal pattern of axial rotation of 7.3\textdegree{} and 4.1\textdegree{} respectively. Eleven of 20 (55\%) patients who had mobile-bearing prostheses implanted and eight of 20 (40\%) patients who had fixed-bearing prostheses implanted did not experience femoral condylar lift-off. The remaining knees had condylar liftoff less than 2.4 mm for fixed-bearing prostheses and 1.7 mm for mobile-bearing prostheses, respectively. Patients who had mobilebearing prostheses implanted experienced greater axial rotation and less condylar lift-off than patients who had fixed-bearing prostheses implanted. Both cruciate ligaments are sacrificed for the mobile and fixed-bearing total knee replacements. The results from the current study showed that, in both groups, the majority of patients experienced kinematics similar to those of a normal knee. However, the extent of lateral femoral condyle posterior rollback and the extent of axial rotation were less.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {Knee kinematics provide information about how the femoral, tibial and patellar bones or prosthetic components move relative to each other. Accurate knowledge of kinematics is valuable for implant design, comparisons between designs or surgical techniques, and to identify differences between patients with good and poor outcomes. Both static and dynamic imaging techniques have been used to evaluate kinematics. In general, static imaging is used to capture better quality images or to capture views that cannot be acquired by dynamic imaging, whereas dynamic imaging is used to capture reallife movements. How well static kinematics represent dynamic kinematics is subject to frequent debate and has not been adequately addressed, especially after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We compared the static and dynamic weightbearing kinematics of 10 female subjects after TKA. Using the same clinical scanner for both methods, static images were taken using our standard protocol, sequentialbiplane radiographs at multiple flexion angles, as well as with dynamic video fluoroscopy during a step up activity. The static method can reliably measure all 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) after TKA, however only seven were compared due to the poorer out-of-plane reliability in the single-plane dynamic imaging. No differences were found between the static and dynamic kinematics for nine out of ten subjects. For one subject, however, a difference of 5\textendash 81 in internal/external tibial rotation was found. The research question, study purpose and the advantages and disadvantages of each method need to be considered when determining which imaging method to use.},

This study accurately quantifies the relative movement between skin and the underlying bone, via X-ray flouroscopy and a mathematical model, in the interest of improving non-invasive knee movement analysis methods. It was found that skin-bone movement varies significantly over both medial and lateral femoral condyles (from 2 to 17 mm rms) and is, therefore, the greatest obstacle by far to obtaining accurate movement data non-intrusively. Data from the prclposed method is fundamental to improving acquisition methods for knee biomechanics and prosthetic analysis and can help in understanding soft tissue movement for orthotic analysis.},

Abnormal kinematics and incongruency of the articular surface may cause increased loads applied to the implant with concomitant polyethylene wear, resulting in loosening and implant failure. The purpose of this study was to measure three-dimensional kinematics of two-component total ankle arthroplasty during non-weightbearing and weightbearing activities, and to investigate incongruency of the articular surfaces during these activities. Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 71 years were enrolled. Radiographs were taken at non-weightbearing maximal dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and weightbearing maximal dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and neutral position. 3D\textendash 2D model-image registration was performed using the radiographs and the three-dimensional implant models, and three-dimensional joint angles were determined. The implanted ankles showed 18.1{$\pm$}8.6\textdegree{} (mean{$\pm$}standard deviation) of plantarflexion, 0.1{$\pm$}0.7\textdegree{} of inversion, 1.2{$\pm$}2.0\textdegree{} of internal rotation, and 0.8{$\pm$}0.6mm of posterior translation of the talar component in the non-weightbearing activity, and 17.8{$\pm$}7.5\textdegree{} of plantarflexion, 0.4{$\pm$}0.5\textdegree{} of inversion, 1.8{$\pm$}2.0\textdegree{} of internal rotation, and 0.7{$\pm$}0.5mm of posterior translation in the weightbearing activity. There were no significant differences between the non-weightbearing and weightbearing kinematics except for the plantarflexion angle. Incongruency of the articular surface occurred in more than 75\% of the ankles. Our observations will provide useful data against which kinematics of other implant designs, such as three-component total ankle arthroplasty, can be compared.},

The fluoroscopic images were recorded with 12 fps and then sent to Matlab software (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for image processing. In parallel, CT scan images of the knee bones were used to create the 3D anatomical geometry of the knee by aid of Mimics software (Materialise NV). However, the geometrical model of the two medial and lateral menisci was generated from MRI data. The 3D geometrical model of the knee was then sent to Abaqus finite element software (Simulia Dassault Systems) to analyse the knee joint contact loads by introducing the boundary condition which was obtained from fluoroscopic images. The finite element model was used to evaluate the stress distribution on the cartilages during the gait. The result was then compared with the experimental data of gait analysis. The comparison between the results showed a close agreement between the two outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: While several studies describe kinematics of healthy and osteoarthritic knees using the accurate imaging and computer modelling now possible, no systematic review exists to synthesise these data. Method: A systematic review extracted quantitative observational, quasi-experimental and experimental studies from PubMed, Scopus, Medline and Web of Science that examined motion of the bony or articular surfaces of the tibiofemoral joint during any functional activity. Studies using surface markers, animals, and in vitro studies were excluded. Results: 352 studies were screened to include 23 studies. Dynamic kinematics were recorded for gait, step-up, kneeling, squat and lunge and quasi-static squat, knee flexion in side-lying or supine legpress. Kinematics were described using a diverse range of measures including six degrees of freedom kinematics, contact patterns or the projection of the femoral condylar axis above the tibia. Metaanalysis of data was not possible since no three papers recorded the same activity with the same measures. Visual evaluation of data revealed that knees with osteoarthritis maintained a more adducted position and showed less posterior translation of the lateral femoral condylar axis than healthy knees. Variability in activities and in recording measures produced greater variation in kinematics, than did knee osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Differences in kinematics between osteoarthritic and healthy knees were observed, however, these differences were more subtle than expected. The synthesis and progress of this research could be facilitated by a consensus on reference systems for axes and kinematic reporting.},

  abstract = {Objectives Throughout the 20th Century, it has been postulated that the knee moves on the basis of a four-bar link mechanism composed of the cruciate ligaments, the femur and the tibia. As a consequence, the femur has been thought to roll back with flexion, and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) prostheses have been designed on this basis. Recent work, however, has proposed that at a position of between 0\textdegree{} and 120\textdegree{} the medial femoral condyle does not move anteroposteriorly whereas the lateral femoral condyle tends, but is not obliged, to roll back \textendash{} a combination of movements which equates to tibial internal/ femoral external rotation with flexion. The aim of this paper was to assess if the articular geometry of the GMK Sphere TKA could recreate the natural knee movements in situ/ in vivo. Methods The pattern of knee movement was studied in 15 patients (six male: nine female; one male with bilateral TKAs) with 16 GMK Sphere implants, at a mean age of 66 years (53 to 76) with a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2 (20 to 35). The motions of all 16 knees were observed using pulsed fluoroscopy during a number of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing static and dynamic activities. Results During maximally flexed kneeling and lunging activities, the mean tibial internal rotation was 8\textdegree{} (standard deviation (sd) 6). At a mean 112\textdegree{} flexion (sd 16) during lunging, the medial and lateral condyles were a mean of 2 mm (sd 3) and 8 mm (sd 4) posterior to a transverse line passing through the centre of the medial tibial concavity. With a mean flexion of 117\textdegree{} (sd 14) during kneeling, the medial and lateral condyles were a mean of 1 mm (sd 4) anterior and 6 mm (sd 4) posterior to the same line. During dynamic stair and pivoting activities, there was a mean anteroposterior translation of 0 mm to 2 mm of the medial femoral condyle. Backward lateral condylar translation occurred and was linearly related to tibial rotation. Conclusion The GMK Sphere TKA in our study group shows movements similar in pattern, although reduced in magnitude, to those in recent reports relating to normal knees during several activities. Specifically, little or no translation of the medial femoral condyle was observed during flexion, but there was posterior roll-back of the lateral femoral condyle, equating to tibiofemoral rotation. We conclude that the GMK Sphere is anteroposteriorly stable medially and permits rotation about the medial compartment.},

The magnitude of the moment arm was defined as the shortest distance between the finite helical axis and the patellar tendon line of action. Using these data, the hypothesis that the patellar tendon moment arm is independent of gender was tested. In general, the moment arm increased from 20 to 50 mm during knee extension. There were significant differences (Po0.05) in the moment arm between gender, but these differences were eliminated when the moment arm was scaled by the femoral epicondylar width. This study took a large step forward towards the ultimate goal of defining how pathology may alter joint dynamics through alteration in moment arms by establishing the first in vivo normative data base for the patellar tendon moment arm using non-invasive measures during volitional activity in a relatively large population (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 34). The fact that the scaled moment arm was independent of gender may lend insights into impairments that tend to be gender specific, such as patellar maltracking. The next steps will be to quantify the patellar tendon moment arm in populations with specific pathologies.},

At the turn of the century, eugenics seemed poised to grant industrial nations unprecedented control over their own future, but that potential depended on contested understandings of the biological mechanisms of inheritance. Early in his career, Keynes helped William Bateson, Britain's chief proponent of Mendelian genetics, analyze problems in human heredity. Simultaneously, Keynes publicly opposed the efforts by Francis Galton and Karl Pearson to study inheritance through statistical biometry. For Keynes, this conflict was morally laden: Mendelism incorporated the only ethical theory of uncertainty, while biometry rested on false and dangerous concepts. This early study of heredity shaped Keynes's visions of industrial democracy after 1918. Liberals looked for a system of societal and economic management to engineer an escape from the postwar Malthusian trap. Britain's economic plight, Keynes argued, was rooted in the hereditary weaknesses of its leadership. Successful technocratic liberalism would depend on control over the quality as well as quantity of human beings. Ultimately, in his essay ``Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,'' Keynes predicted that effective eugenic management would bring about capitalism's end.},

The alignment of the quadriceps muscle and patella suggests that the patella should deviate laterally out of the patellar groove as the quadriceps muscle contracts during walking. The surgical treatment of patellar subluxation has been based on this presumption. The purpose of this study was to determine the movements of the patella in relation to the other bones of the knee joint during normal walking. This is the first study we know of that uses radiographs to show these movements. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eight healthy adult volunteers with no previous cornplaints referable to the knee walked on a slowly moving treadmill while their patellae were imaged fluoroscopically in the anteroposterior plane with a Toshiba C-arm. Images were retrieved, transferred to radiographic film, and randomized to prevent the observers from knowing the order of images. The position of the patella was measured and plotted in relation to fixed points of the knee. RESULTS. In each of the subjects at every gait cycle, the patella was observed to move vertically first, followed by a sudden shift to the medial side before returning to its original position. CONCLUSION. Contrary to conventional understanding, our results show that the patella deviates medially rather than laterally during walking. This occurs because of differential contraction},

  abstract = {Background: It is often assumed that body posture, standing vs. supine, changes shoulder muscle activation and range of motion, but these altered shoulder mechanics have not been objectively assessed. We expected the supine posture might facilitate scapular rotation and change subacromial pressure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of body posture on shoulder kinematics during arm elevation. Methods: Ten males and eight females with a mean age of 33 years participated in this study. Shoulder kinematics were assessed during scapular plane elevation in the standing and supine postures by using single-plane fluoroscopic images. Kinematics were measured using 3-dimensional to 2-dimensional model-image registration techniques: matching the 3-dimensional bone model derived from computed tomography onto each fluoroscopic image. Glenohumeral superior/inferior translation, acromiohumeral distance, and scapular rotations were compared between the postures. The effect of sex also was evaluated. Results: With the arm at the side position, the humeral head in the supine posture was located 0.5 mm superior compared to the standing posture (P {$<$} .001). During humeral elevation, the humeral head significantly shifted more inferiorly in the supine posture than in standing; the biggest mean difference was 0.6 mm, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .003. But acromiohumeral distance during elevation was not significantly affected by the body posture (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .05). Scapular upward rotation and posterior tilt were significantly different between the postures (P {$<$} .001). Sex had statistically significant, but quantitatively small, effects on shoulder kinematics. Conclusions: Body postures affect shoulder kinematics during humeral elevation. This knowledge will be useful to optimize rehabilitation exercises and for diagnostic insight. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

A unit dual quaternion is an 8 parameter nonsingular representation of pose and has previously been used for pose estimation with Kalman filters (KF). We formulate a cost function in terms of the quaternion product and propose a MHE that includes the N latest measurements in the estimation. In addition, we suggest a measurement relation based on the Cayley transform of the noise, where the noise has a Gaussian distribution about the x-y-z and roll-pitch-yaw parameters of the pose. The MHE is compared against the dual quaternion multiplicative extended KF (DQ-MEKF) and the twistor-based unscented KF (T-UKF) through 100 Monte Carlo simulations, where the simulated data is generated according to the defined system dynamics. It is found that the MHE gives more accurate pose estimation results.},

Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics. Result: First we present an overview of 20 evaluation metrics selected based on a comprehensive literature review. For fuzzy segmentation, which shows the level of membership of each voxel to multiple classes, fuzzy definitions of all metrics are provided. We present a discussion about metric properties to provide a guide for selecting evaluation metrics. Finally, we propose an efficient evaluation tool implementing the 20 selected metrics. The tool is optimized to perform efficiently in terms of speed and required memory, also if the image size is extremely large as in the case of whole body MRI or CT volume segmentation. An implementation of this tool is available as an open source project. Conclusion: We propose an efficient evaluation tool for 3D medical image segmentation using 20 evaluation metrics and provide guidelines for selecting a subset of these metrics that is suitable for the data and the segmentation task.},

For each frame of the fluoroscopy data, the relative location of the femoral and tibial components were determined, and the apparent intersection of the femoral component with the tibial insert was used to calculate wear volume, wear depth, and frequency of intersection. No difference was found between the measured and true wear volumes. The precision of the measurements was {$\pm$}39.7 mm3 for volume and {$\pm$}0.126 mm for wear depth. The results suggest the system is capable of tracking wear volume changes across multiple time points in patients. As a dynamic technique, this method can provide both kinematic and wear measurements that may be useful for evaluating new implant designs for total knee replacements.},

  abstract = {Combining accurate bone kinematics data from biplane radiography with cartilage models from magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to estimate tibiofemoral cartilage contact area and centroid location. Proper validation of such estimates, however, has not been performed under loading conditions approximating functional tasks, such as gait, squatting, and stair descent. The goal of this study was to perform an in vitro validation to resolve the accuracy of cartilage contact estimations in comparison to a laser scanning gold standard. Results demonstrated acceptable reliability and accuracy for both contact area and centroid location estimates. Root mean square errors in contact area averaged 8.4\% and 4.4\% of the medial and lateral compartmental areas, respectively. Modified Sorensen-Dice agreement scores of contact regions averaged 0.81 {$\pm$} 0.07 for medial and 0.83 {$\pm$} 0.07 for lateral compartments. These validated methods have applications for in vivo assessment of a variety of patient populations and physical activities, and may lead to greater understanding of the relationships between knee cartilage function, effects of joint injury and treatment, and the development of osteoarthritis.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Accurate measurement of the three-dimensional ͑3D͒ rigid body and surface kinematics of the natural human knee is essential for many clinical applications. Existing techniques are limited either in their accuracy or lack more realistic experimental evaluation of the measurement errors. The purposes of the study were to develop a volumetric model-based 2D to 3D registration method, called the weighted edge-matching score ͑WEMS͒ method, for measuring natural knee kinematics with single-plane fluoroscopy to determine experimentally the measurement errors and to compare its performance with that of pattern intensity ͑PI͒ and gradient difference ͑GD͒ methods. Methods: The WEMS method gives higher priority to matching of longer edges of the digitally reconstructed radiograph and fluoroscopic images. The measurement errors of the methods were evaluated based on a human cadaveric knee at 11 flexion positions. Results: The accuracy of the WEMS method was determined experimentally to be less than 0.77 mm for the in-plane translations, 3.06 mm for out-of-plane translation, and 1.13\textdegree{} for all rotations, which is better than that of the PI and GD methods. Conclusions: A new volumetric model-based 2D to 3D registration method has been developed for measuring 3D in vivo kinematics of natural knee joints with single-plane fluoroscopy. With the equipment used in the current study, the accuracy of the WEMS method is considered acceptable for the measurement of the 3D kinematics of the natural knee in clinical applications. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. ͓DOI: 10.1118/1.3301596͔},

This study presents a simultaneous in vivo measurement of tibiofemoral articular contact forces and contact kinematics in three TKA patients. These measurements were accomplished via a dual fluoroscopic imaging system and instrumented tibial implants, during dynamic single leg lunge and chair rising\textendash sitting. The measured forces and contact locations were also used to determine mediolateral distribution of axial contact forces. Contact kinematics data showed a medial pivot during flexion of the knee, for all patients in the study. Average axial forces were higher for lunge compared to chair rising\textendash sitting (224\% vs. 187\% body weight). In this study, we measured peak anteroposterior and mediolateral forces averaging 13.3\% BW during lunge and 18.5\% BW during chair rising\textendash sitting. Mediolateral distributions of axial contact force were both patient and activity specific. All patients showed equitable medial\textendash lateral loading during lunge but greater loads at the lateral compartment during chair rising\textendash sitting. The results of this study may enable more accurate reproduction of in vivo loads and articular motion patterns in wear simulators and finite element models. This in turn may help advance our understanding of factors limiting longevity of TKA implants, such as aseptic loosening and polyethylene component wear, and enable improved TKA designs.},

Our method of threedimensional shape analysis using normalized Fourier descriptors is in\- formation preserving, yet is as fast as previous suboptimum methods. In addition, our feature vector has a linear property, allowing us to interpolate between library projections and effectively define a con\- tinuum of library projections rather than a finite set. This method is applied to the analysis of sequential data varying in resolution and orientation relative to the camera. Computational considerations are discussed, and it is seen that real-time implementation of the method is feasible.},

Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image as a low-resolution representation through a subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions in series (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet), and then recover the high-resolution representation from the encoded low-resolution representation. Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

Fifty-six knees were studied using dynamic radiography at least one year post-surgery, with twenty-seven knees retaining the PCL and twenty-nine knees having the PCL sacrificed. Consistent with our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees showed more anterior femoral condylar positions. Contrary to our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees demonstrated greater knee flexion during kneeling (122\textdegree{} versus 115\textdegree ). Contracted PCLs in severely deformed knees likely were the cause of limited flexion in some retaining knees.},

Recent transfer learning approaches for behavioral tracking have considerably advanced the state of the art. Typically these methods treat each video frame and each object to be tracked independently. In this work, we improve on these methods (particularly in the regime of few training labels) by leveraging the rich spatiotemporal structures pervasive in behavioral video \textemdash{} specifically, the spatial statistics imposed by physical constraints (e.g., paw to elbow distance), and the temporal statistics imposed by smoothness from frame to frame. We propose a probabilistic graphical model built on top of deep neural networks, Deep Graph Pose (DGP), to leverage these useful spatial and temporal constraints, and develop an efficient structured variational approach to perform inference in this model. The resulting semi-supervised model exploits both labeled and unlabeled frames to achieve significantly more accurate and robust tracking while requiring users to label fewer training frames.

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2-D)/three-dimensional (3-D) registration techniques using single-plane fluoroscopy are highly important for analyzing 3-D kinematics in applications such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants. The accuracy of single-plane fluoroscopy-based techniques in the determination of translation perpendicular to the image plane (depth position), however, is relatively poor because a change in the depth position causes only small changes in the 2-D silhouette. Accuracies achieved in depth position using conventional 2-D/3-D registration techniques are insufficient for clinical applications. Therefore, we propose a technique for improving the accuracy of depth position determination in order to develop a system for analyzing knee kinematics over the full six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) using single-plane fluoroscopy. In preliminary experiments, the behaviors of errors for each free variable were quantified as evaluation curves by examining changes in cost function with variations in the free variable. The evaluation curve for depth position was more jagged, and the curve peak less pointy, compared to the evaluation curves of the other five variables, and the curve was found to behave differently. Depth position is therefore optimized independently of the other variables, using an approximate evaluation curve of depth position prepared after initial registration. Accuracy of the proposed technique was evaluated by computer simulation and in vitro tests, with validation of absolute position and orientation performed for each knee component. In computer simulation tests, root-mean-square error (RMSE) in depth position was improved from 2.6 mm (conventional) to 0.9 mm (proposed), whereas for in vitro tests, RMSE improved from 3.2 mm to 1.4 mm. Accuracy of the estimation of the remaining two translational and three rotational variables was found to be almost the same as that obtained by conventional techniques. Results of in vivo tests are also described in which the possibility of full 6 DOF kinematic analysis of TKA implants is shown.},

In vivo kinametcis of the metallic knee implant was determined using a 2D/3D registration technique, which uses computer assisted design (CAD) model of the implant to estimate the 3D pose of radiopaque metallic femoral and tibial components from a single-plane fluoroscopic image. In fixed-bearing TKA, a 3D pose of radiolucent tibial polyethylene insert can be determined from the estimated pose of the tibial component. To visualize femorotibial contact, the proximity between surfaces of femoral component and tibial insert was calculated, and mapped onto the insert surface model. For the clinical application, dynamic states of contact on the tibial insert were observed including axial rotation and unilateral loading during knee flexion, and post-cam contact of posterior stabilized TKA. The present technique provided us new information and enabled us to better understand the relationship between in vivo knee kinematics and articular shape of the implant.},

A three-dimensional (3-D) model-based method is presented to estimate skeletal motion of the knee from high-speed sequences of biplane radiographs. The method implicitly assumes that geometrical features cannot be detected reliably and an exact segmentation of bone edges is not always feasible. An existing biplane radiograph system was simulated as two separate single-plane radiograph systems. Position and orientation of the underlying bone was determined for each single-plane view by generating projections through a 3-D volumetric model (from computed tomography), and producing an image (digitally reconstructed radiograph) similar (based on texture information and rough edges of bone) to the two\textendash dimensional radiographs. The absolute 3-D pose was determined using known imaging geometry of the biplane radiograph system and a 3-D line intersection method. Results were compared to data of known accuracy, obtained from a previously established bone-implanted marker method. Difference of controlled in vitro tests was on the order of 0.5 mm for translation and 1.4 for rotation. A biplane radiograph sequence of a canine hindlimb during treadmill walking was used for in vivo testing, with differences on the order of 0.8 mm for translation and 2.5 for rotation.},

Our approach processes only the input image through two steps: (i) localize the boundary pixels and (ii) identify the corresponding interior pixel for each boundary pixel. We build the correspondence by learning a direction away from the boundary pixel to an interior pixel. Our method requires no prior information of the segmentation models and achieves nearly real-time speed. We empirically verify that our SegFix consistently reduces the boundary errors for segmentation results generated from various stateof-the-art models on Cityscapes, ADE20K and GTA5.

  abstract = {Data augmentation (DA) has been widely utilized to improve generalization in training deep neural networks. Recently, human-designed data augmentation has been gradually replaced by automatically learned augmentation policy. Through finding the best policy in well-designed search space of data augmentation, AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2018) can significantly improve validation accuracy on image classification tasks. However, this approach is not computationally practical for large-scale problems. In this paper, we develop an adversarial method to arrive at a computationally-affordable solution called Adversarial AutoAugment, which can simultaneously optimize target related object and augmentation policy search loss. The augmentation policy network attempts to increase the training loss of a target network through generating adversarial augmentation policies, while the target network can learn more robust features from harder examples to improve the generalization. In contrast to prior work, we reuse the computation in target network training for policy evaluation, and dispense with the retraining of the target network. Compared to AutoAugment, this leads to about 12\texttimes{} reduction in computing cost and 11\texttimes{} shortening in time overhead on ImageNet. We show experimental results of our approach on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art. On CIFAR-10, we achieve a top-1 test error of 1.36\%, which is the currently best performing single model. On ImageNet, we achieve a leading performance of top-1 accuracy 79.40\% on ResNet-50 and 80.00\% on ResNet-50-D without extra data.},

  abstract = {Abstract   In recent years, approaches based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in point cloud learning. The typical pipeline of GCNs is modeled as a two-stage learning process: graph construction and feature learning. We argue that such process exhibits low efciency because a high percentage of the total time is consumed during the graph construction process when a large amount of sparse data are required to be accessed rather than on actual feature learning. To alleviate this problem, we propose a graph-based parallel branch network (Graph-PBN) that introduces a parallel branch structure to point cloud learning in this study. In particular, Graph-PBN is composed of two branches: the PointNet branch and the GCN branch. PointNet exhibits advantages in memory access and computational cost, while GCN behaves better in local context modeling. The two branches are combined in our architecture to utilize the potential of PointNet and GCN fully, facilitating the achievement of efcient and accurate recognition results. To better aggregate the features of each node in GCN, we investigate a novel operator, called EAGConv, to augment their local context by fully utilizing geometric and semantic features in a local graph. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, and experiment results validate the signicant performance of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

Kinematic and kinetic information of a TKA is crucial for the improvement of implant designs and for the increased longevity of the implant components. Instrumented gait analysis, with skin mounted marker tracking and force plates, is a well-established method for the acquisition of kinematic and kinetic data of TKA in vivo and for non-invasive estimation of joint function. However, resultant moments at the knee joint are inaccurate with this method, due to skin movement artifacts. Video-fluoroscopy reduces these inaccuracies by means of the direct tracking of the implant components with X-ray. However this measuring technique carries disadvantages: it provides only kinematic data, and the image intensifier covers a limited field of view. This paper presents a newly developed measuring technique, which enables a more accurate resultant moments calculation for level walking than could be achieved by conventional instrumented gait analysis.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new method to track bone movements in stereoscopic X-ray image series of the knee joint. The method is based on two different X-ray image sets: a rotational series of acquisitions of the still subject knee that allows the tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional volume (model), and a stereoscopic image series of orthogonal projections as the subject performs movements. Tracking the movements of bones throughout the stereoscopic image series means to determine, for each frame, the best pose of every moving element (bone) previously identified in the 3D reconstructed model. The quality of a pose is reflected in the similarity between its theoretical projections and the actual radiographs. We use direct Fourier reconstruction to approximate the three-dimensional volume of the knee joint. Then, to avoid the expensive computation of digitally rendered radiographs (DRR) for pose recovery, we develop a corollary to the 3-dimensional central-slice theorem and reformulate the tracking problem in the Fourier domain. Under the hypothesis of parallel X-ray beams, the heavy 2D-to-3D registration of projections in the signal domain is replaced by efficient slice-tovolume registration in the Fourier domain. Focusing on rotational movements, the translation-relevant phase information can be discarded and we only consider scalar Fourier amplitudes. The core of our motion tracking algorithm can be implemented as a classical frame-wise slice-to-volume registration task. Results on both synthetic and real images confirm the validity of our approach.},

  abstract = {A better knowledge of the kinematics behavior of total knee replacement (TKR) during activity still remains a crucial issue to validate innovative prosthesis designs and different surgical strategies. Tools for more accurate measurement of in vivo kinematics of knee prosthesis components are therefore fundamental to improve the clinical outcome of knee replacement. In the present study, a novel model-based method for the estimation of the three-dimensional (3-D) position and orientation (pose) of both the femoral and tibial knee prosthesis components during activity is presented. The knowledge of the 3-D geometry of the components and a single plane projection view in a fluoroscopic image are sufficient to reconstruct the absolute and relative pose of the components in space. The technique is based on the best alignment of the component designs with the corresponding projection on the image plane. The image generation process is modeled and an iterative procedure localizes the spatial pose of the object by minimizing the Euclidean distance of the projection rays from the object surface. Computer simulation and static/dynamic in vitro tests using real knee prosthesis show that the accuracy with which relative orientation and position of the components can be estimated is better than 1.5  and 1.5 mm, respectively. In vivo tests demonstrate that the method is well suited for kinematics analysis on TKR patients and that good quality images can be obtained with a carefully positioning of the fluoroscope and an appropriate dosage. With respect to previously adopted template matching techniques, the present method overcomes the complete segmentation of the components on the projected image and also features the simultaneous evaluation of all the six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the object. The expected small difference between successive poses in in vivo sequences strongly reduces the frequency of false poses and both the operator and computation time.},
