  abstract = {This paper features an advanced implementation of the X-ray rendering algorithm that harnesses the giant computing power of the current commodity graphics processors to accelerate the generation of high resolution digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). The presented pipeline exploits the latest features of NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architectures, mainly bindless texture objects and dynamic parallelism. The rendering throughput is substantially improved by exploiting the interoperability mechanisms between CUDA and OpenGL. The benchmarks of our optimized rendering pipeline reflect its capability of generating DRRs with resolutions of 20482 and 40962 at interactive and semi interactive frame-rates using an NVIDIA GeForce 970 GTX device.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the cheminformatics and qualitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. The effects of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol on the viability, doubling time and adipogenic or osteogenic differentiations of human adiposederived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) were also investigated. Materials and Methods: QSAR and toxicity indices of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol were evaluated using cheminformatics tools including Toxtree and Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T) and molinspiration server. Besides, their effects on the hASCs viability, doubling time and differentiation to adipogenic or osteogenic lineages were evaluated. Results: Cinnamaldehyde is predicted to be more lipophilic and less toxic than eugenol. Both phytochemicals may be developmental toxicants. They probably undergo hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions by cytochrome-P450. The 2.5 {\textmu}M/ml cinnamaldehyde and 0.1 {\textmu}g/ml eugenol did not influence hASCs viability following 72 hr of treatment. But higher concentrations of these phytochemicals insignificantly increased hASCs doubling time till 96 hr, except 1 {\textmu}g/ml eugenol for which the increase was significant. Only low concentrations of both phytochemicals were tested for their effects on the hASCs differentiation. The 2.5 {\textmu}M/ml cinnamaldehyde and 0.1 {\textmu}g/ml eugenol enhanced the osteogenesis and decreased the adipogenesis of hASCs meaningfully. Conclusion: According to the cheminformatics analysis and in vitro study, cinnamaldehyde and eugenol are biocompatible and low toxic for hASCs. Both phytochemicals may be suitable for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering when used at low concentrations, but maybe useful for neoplastic growth inhibition when used at high concentrations.},

There is an increasing amount of research to support the clear disassociation between the loss of muscle lean tissue mass and strength with aging. This disassociation implies that factors in addition to lean muscle mass are responsible for the decreases in strength and function seen with aging. Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a significant predictor of both muscle function and mobility function in older adults and across a wide variety of comorbid conditions such as stroke, spinal cord injury, diabetes, and COPD. IMAT is also implicated in metabolic dysfunction such as insulin resistance. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a review of the implications of increased IMAT levels in metabolic, muscle, and mobility function. Potential treatment options to mitigate increasing levels of IMAT will also be discussed.},

A total of 30 UKAs implanted in 18 patients were analyzed. All patients were implanted with a medial Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee System (Zimmer Inc, Warsaw, Ind). Under fluoroscopic surveillance, each patient performed weight-bearing deep knee bend, normal gait, and passive flexion. The kinematics of the medial UKA was determined using a 3-dimensional model registration technique. On average, the implant experienced posterior femoral rollback and normal axial rotation during flexion. However, the kinematic patterns for each patient were not consistent, and the variability was high during flexion and stance phase of gait.

  abstract = {Several pathologies can alter the way people walk, i.e. their gait. Gait analysis can therefore be used to detect impairments and help diagnose illnesses and assess patient recovery. Using vision-based systems, diagnoses could be done at home or in a clinic, with the needed computation being done remotely. State-of-the-art vision-based gait analysis systems use deep learning, requiring large datasets for training. However, to our best knowledge, the biggest publicly available pathological gait dataset contains only 10 subjects, simulating 4 gait pathologies. This paper presents a new dataset called GAIT-IT, captured from 21 subjects simulating 4 gait pathologies, with 2 severity levels, besides normal gait, being considerably larger than publicly available gait pathology datasets, allowing to train a deep learning model for gait pathology classification. Moreover, it was recorded in a professional studio, making it possible to obtain nearly perfect silhouettes, free of segmentation errors. Recognizing the importance of remote healthcare, this paper proposes a prototype of a web application allowing to upload a walking person's video, possibly acquired using a smartphone camera, and execute a web service that classifies the person's gait as normal or across different pathologies. The web application has a user friendly interface and could be used by healthcare professionals or other end users. An automatic gait analysis system is also developed and integrated with the web application for pathology classification. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, it achieves a drastic reduction in the number of model parameters, which means significantly lower memory requirements, as well as lower training and execution times. Classification accuracy is on par with the state-of-the-art.},

These advances have led to numerous clinical trials in such diverse areas as the delivery of anti-cancer, anti-fungal and antibiotic drugs, the delivery of gene medicines, and the delivery of anesthetics and anti-inflammatory drugs. A number of liposomes (lipidic nanoparticles) are on the market, and many more are in the pipeline. Lipidic nanoparticles are the first nanomedicine delivery system to make the transition from concept to clinical application, and they are now an established technology platform with considerable clinical acceptance. We can look forward to many more clinical products in the future.},

Randomized controlled trial Sixty-one selected participants with KOA grades 2 and 3, 40{\textendash}65years old, and BMI {$<$}30kg/m2 were randomized into three groups: CT, conventional strength training (ST), and educational protocol (EP). The CT and ST protocols consisted of 14-week training protocols conducted 3 times a week. The CT group performed exercises stratified as light, moderate, and intense, arranged progressively in a circuit model. The ST group performed conventional strength exercises, and the EP group participated in lectures twice a month about healthy lifestyles. Baseline and follow-up (week 0 and week 14) evaluations were conducted for thigh intermuscular fat (computed tomography), knee extension maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC), and muscle quality (knee extension MIVC/muscle mass cross-sectional area). Only the CT group presented significant reductions in thigh intermuscular fat (p=0.003) and significantly lower values in week 14 compared with the EP (p=0.032). Both trained groups presented significant increases in muscle mass area (p=0.002 for CT and p=0.008 for ST) and increments in knee extension MIVC (p=0,033 for CT nd p=0.019 for ST)in week 14 compared with the EP and increases in muscle quality (p=0.004 and 0.042). It can be concluded that a 14-week periodized CT protocol attenuates thigh intermuscular fat and improves muscle quality in patients with KOA.

To this end, radiomics has been proposed as a field of study where images are used instead of invasive methods. The first step in radiomic analysis in oncology is lesion segmentation. However, this task is time consuming and can be physician subjective. Automated tools based on supervised deep learning have made great progress in helping physicians. However, they are data hungry, and annotated data remains a major issue in the medical field where only a small subset of annotated images are available.In this work, we propose a multi-task, multi-scale learning framework to predict patient's survival and response. We show that the encoder can leverage multiple tasks to extract meaningful and powerful features that improve radiomic performance. We also show that subsidiary tasks serve as an inductive bias so that the model can better generalize.Our model was tested and validated for treatment response and survival in esophageal and lung cancers, with an area under the ROC curve of 77\% and 71\% respectively, outperforming single-task learning methods.Multi-task multi-scale learning enables higher performance of radiomic analysis by extracting rich information from intratumoral and peritumoral regions.},

Phytochemicals are potential agents to inhibit differentiation of preadipocytes, stimulate lipolysis, and induce apoptosis of existing adipocytes, thereby reducing the amount of adipose tissue. Flavonoids and stilbenoids represent the most researched groups of phytochemicals with regards to their effect on adipogenesis, but there are also a number of in vitro and in vivo studies with phenolic acids, alkaloids, and vitamins, as well as other plant compounds. Although phytochemicals like epigallocatechin-3-gallate, genistein, and resveratrol reduce lipid accumulation and induce adipocyte apoptosis in vitro and reduce body weight and adipose tissues mass in animal models of diet-induced obesity, well-conducted clinical trials are lacking. Pharmacological doses are often used in vitro and when applied in physiological doses in animals or humans, the phytochemicals are often ineffective in affecting adipogenesis. However, by combining several phytochemicals or using them as templates for synthesizing new drugs, there is a large potential in targeting adipogenesis using phytochemicals. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {A new technique is presented that utilizes relative velocity vectors between articulating surfaces to characterize internal/external rotation of the tibio-femoral joint during dynamic loading. Precise tibiofemoral motion was determined by tracking the movement of implanted tantalum beads in high-speed biplane X-rays. Three-dimensional, subject-specific CT reconstructions of the femur and tibia, consisting of triangular mesh elements, were positioned in each analyzed frame. The minimum distance between subchondral bone surfaces was recorded for each mesh element comprising each bone surface, and the relative velocity between these opposing closest surface elements was determined in each frame. Internal/external rotation was visualized by superimposing tangential relative velocity vectors onto bone surfaces at each instant. Rotation about medial and lateral compartments was quantified by calculating the angle between these tangential relative vectors within each compartment. Results acquired from 68 test sessions involving 23 dogs indicated a consistent pattern of sequential rotation about the lateral condyle (approximately 60 ms after paw strike) followed by rotation about the medial condyle (approximately 100 ms after paw strike). These results imply that axial knee rotation follows a repeatable pattern within and among subjects. This pattern involves rotation about both the lateral and medial compartments. The technique described can be easily applied to study human knee internal/external rotation during a variety of activities. This information may be useful to define normal and pathologic conditions, to confirm post-surgical restoration of knee mechanics, and to design more realistic prosthetic devices. Furthermore, analysis of joint arthrokinematics, such as those described, may identify changes in joint mechanics associated with joint degeneration.},

The framework is divided into an Initiation Phase and a Progression Phase. The Initiation Phase is associated with kinematic changes that shift load bearing to infrequently loaded regions of the cartilage that cannot accommodate the loads. The Progression Phase is defined following cartilage breakdown. During the Progression Phase, the disease progresses more rapidly with increased load. While this framework was developed from an analysis of in vivopathomechanics, it also explains how the convergence of biological, morphological, and neuromuscular changes to the musculoskeletal system during aging or during menopause lead to the increased rate of idiopathic OA with aging. Understanding the in vivo response of articular cartilage to its physical environment requires an integrated view of the problem that considers functional, anatomical, and biological interactions. The integrated in vivoframework presented here will be helpful for the interpretation of laboratory experiments as well as for the development of new methods for the evaluation of OA at the knee.},

Recent Findings Recent studies have supported earlier findings that a high adduction moment at the knee during ambulation was most frequently reported to influence the progression of medial compartment osteoarthritis. In contrast to previous findings in patients with osteoarthritis, recent work on healthy subjects reports that cartilage thickness increases with high ambulatory loads. Kinematic changes were associated with the initiation of osteoarthritis. Recent studies of subjects with high risk factors for knee osteoarthritis (obesity and anterior cruciate ligament injury) reported a relationship between kinematic changes during ambulation and the initiation of osteoarthritis at the knee. This review also contrasts the relative influence on osteoarthritis of knee mechanics measured during ambulatory and nonambulatory activities. Summary The initiation of osteoarthritis occurs when healthy cartilage experiences some condition (traumatic or chronic) that causes kinematic changes during ambulation at the knee to shift the load-bearing contact location of the joint to a region not conditioned to the new loading. The rate of progression of osteoarthritis is associated with increased load during ambulation.},

QSAR study was applied to elucidate the relationship between the molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties of polyphenol analogues and their DPPH radical scavenging capability, to guide the design and discovery of highly-potent antioxidant substances more efficiently. PubMed database was used to collect 99 PCs with antioxidant activity, whereas, 105 negative PCs were found in ChEMBL database; their molecular descriptors were generated with Python's Rdkit package. While the molecular descriptors significantly related to the antioxidant activity of PCs were filtered by t -test. The prediction QSAR model was then established by discriminant analysis, and the obtained model was verified by the back-substitution and Leave-One-Out cross-validation methods along with heat map. It was revealed that the anti-DPPH radical activity of PCs was correlated with the drug-likeness and molecular fingerprints, physicochemical, topological, constitutional and electronic property. The established QSAR model could explicitly predict the antioxidant activity of polyphenols, thus were applicable to evaluate the potential of candidates as antioxidants.},

The underlying models have to consider spatial properties such as shape or extension as well as thematic attributes. We introduce 3D shape histograms as an intuitive and powerful similarity model for 3D objects. Particular flexibility is provided by using quadratic form distance functions in order to account for errors of measurement, sampling, and numerical rounding that all may result in small displacements and rotations of shapes. For query processing, a general filter-refinement architecture is employed that efficiently supports similarity search based on quadratic forms. An experimental evaluation in the context of molecular biology demonstrates both, the high classification accuracy of more than 90\% and the good performance of the approach.},

This provides greater stability in flexion by creating a greater jump distance and reduces the stress on the tibial spine. In order to eliminate edge loading of the femoral component on the posterior tibial articular surface, the posterior femoral condyles need to be extended. This provides an ideal femoral contact with the tibial articular surface during high flexion angles. To reduce extensor mechanism impingement in deep flexion, the anterior margin of the tibial articular component should be recessed. This provides clearance for the patella and patella tendon.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of minimization of a nonsmooth function under general nonsmooth constraints when no derivatives of the objective or constraint functions are available. We introduce the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) class of algorithms which extends the generalized pattern search (GPS) class by allowing local exploration, called polling, in an asymptotically dense set of directions in the space of optimization variables. This means that under certain hypotheses, including a weak constraint qualification due to Rockafellar, MADS can treat constraints by the extreme barrier approach of setting the objective to infinity for infeasible points and treating the problem as unconstrained. The main GPS convergence result is to identify limit points \${\textbackslash}hat\{x\}\$, where the Clarke generalized derivatives are nonnegative in a finite set of directions, called refining directions. Although in the unconstrained case, nonnegative combinations of these directions span the whole space, the fact that there can only be finitely many GPS refining directions limits rigorous justification of the barrier approach to finitely many linear constraints for GPS. The main result of this paper is that the general MADS framework is flexible enough to allow the generation of an asymptotically dense set of refining directions along which the Clarke derivatives are nonnegative. We propose an instance of MADS for which the refining directions are dense in the hypertangent cone at \${\textbackslash}hat\{x\}\$ with probability 1 whenever the iterates associated with the refining directions converge to a single \${\textbackslash}hat\{x\}\$. The instance of MADS is compared to versions of GPS on some test problems. We also illustrate the limitation of our results with examples.},

Because the motions of total knee implants have a direct influence on patient function and device longevity, it is important to understand how knee implants based on a variety of design philosophies perform in vivo. Fifty-nine knees in patients with 5 designs of implants were studied with fluoroscopic imaging during gait and stair-climbing activities. Many knees showed significantly different kinematics between the gait and stair activities, as well as differences from knees having other implant designs. The measured motions were consistent with the intrinsic constraint provided by the implant components and the variation in constraint over the flexion range.

It is commonly assumed that achieving closer-to-normal knee mechanics in a TKA will result in further improvement in outcomes and revision rates. Fixed-bearing TKA designs with asymmetric pivoting articulations are designed to provide more natural joint stability and kinematics. These designs have been used for more than 20 years and there is a substantial body of literature characterizing their performance. This article reviews the various design types of fixed-bearing pivoting TKA designs, and recounts their clinical, functional, and patient-preference performance from peer-reviewed studies. To date, the evidence suggests there is measurable benefit to providing closer-to-normal joint stability and kinematics, and that fixed-bearing, pivoting TKA designs may decrease instability-related revisions and improve patient satisfaction.},

Three groups of knee arthroplasty subjects with excellent clinical outcomes and similar ranges of motion were evaluated. Each group received different prosthetic components and surgical treatments of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Group 1 had relatively fiat articular surfaces with retention of the bony insertion of the PCL, group 2 had similar articular geometry but recessed the PCL without retaining the bony insertion, and group 3 had prostheses with greater sagittal conformity and post/cam substitution of the sacrificed PCL. Although none of the knees exhibited normal knee kinematics, the ranges of axial rotation and condylar translation for group 1 were similar to ranges previously reported for normal and anterior cruciate-deficient knees. Axial rotations and condylar translations decreased w h e n the PCL was surgically recessed or substituted. The smallest kinematic ranges were observed in group 3. The results indicate that both prosthetic component selection and surgical technique have a significant effect on prosthetic knee kinematics during functional activities.

This review summarizes current methods for assessing postoperative outcomes on a biomechanical basis, organizes them into three complementary domains, and suggests how these domains must be linked to address the titular question.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of ``thick'' facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

In addition to intensity variations and structural differences between images, they may have partial or full overlap, which adds an extra hurdle to the success of registration process. In this contribution, we propose a multi-modal to mono-modal transformation method that facilitates direct application of well-founded mono-modal registration methods in order to obtain accurate alignment of multi-modal images in both cases, with complete (full) and incomplete (partial) overlap. The proposed transformation facilitates recovering strong scales, rotations, and translations. We explain the method thoroughly and discuss the choice of parameters. For evaluation purposes, the effectiveness of the proposed method is examined and compared with widely used information theory-based techniques using simulated and clinical human brain images with full data. Using RIRE dataset, mean absolute error of 1.37, 1.00, and 1.41 mm are obtained for registering CT images with PD-, T1-, and T2-MRIs, respectively. In the end, we empirically investigate the efficacy of the proposed transformation in registering multi-modal partially overlapped images.},

The convolution operation however has a significant weakness in that it only operates on a local neighbourhood, thus missing global information. Self-attention, on the other hand, has emerged as a recent advance to capture long range interactions, but has mostly been applied to sequence modeling and generative modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose to augment convolutional networks with self-attention by concatenating convolutional feature maps with a set of feature maps produced via a novel relative self-attention mechanism. In particular, we extend previous work on relative self-attention over sequences to images and discuss a memory efficient implementation. Unlike Squeeze-and-Excitation, which performs attention over the channels and ignores spatial information, our self-attention mechanism attends jointly to both features and spatial locations while preserving translation equivariance. We find that Attention Augmentation leads to consistent improvements in image classification on ImageNet and object detection on COCO across many different models and scales, including ResNets and a state-of-the art mobile constrained network, while keeping the number of parameters similar. In particular, our method achieves a 1.3\% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet classification over a ResNet50 baseline and outperforms other attention mechanisms for images such as Squeeze-and-Excitation. It also achieves an improvement of 1.4 AP in COCO Object Detection on top of a RetinaNet baseline.},

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by 1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, 2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits, and the COIL data set.},

The segmentation results were assessed by several indices used for measuring the output quality of image segmentation algorithms.

  abstract = {Deep learning-based MRI diagnosis of internal joint derangement is an emerging field of artificial intelligence, which offers many exciting possibilities for musculoskeletal radiology. A variety of investigational deep learning algorithms have been developed to detect anterior cruciate ligament tears, meniscus tears, and rotator cuff disorders. Additional deep learning-based MRI algorithms have been investigated to detect Achilles tendon tears, recurrence prediction of musculoskeletal neoplasms, and complex segmentation of nerves, bones, and muscles. Proof-of-concept studies suggest that deep learning algorithms may achieve similar diagnostic performances when compared to human readers in meta-analyses; however, musculoskeletal radiologists outperformed most deep learning algorithms in studies including a direct comparison. Earlier investigations and developments of deep learning algorithms focused on the binary classification of the presence or absence of an abnormality, whereas more advanced deep learning algorithms start to include features for characterization and severity grading. While many studies have focused on comparing deep learning algorithms against human readers, there is a paucity of data on the performance differences of radiologists interpreting musculoskeletal MRI studies without and with artificial intelligence support. Similarly, studies demonstrating the generalizability and clinical applicability of deep learning algorithms using realistic clinical settings with workflow-integrated deep learning algorithms are sparse. Contingent upon future studies showing the clinical utility of deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence may eventually translate into clinical practice to assist detection and characterization of various conditions on musculoskeletal MRI exams.},

  abstract = {Background: Patients after primary hip or knee replacement surgery can benefit from postoperative treatment in terms of improvement of independence in ambulation, transfers, range of motion and muscle strength. After discharge from hospital, patients are referred to different treatment destination and modalities: intensive inpatient rehabilitation (IR), cure (medically prescribed stay at a convalescence center), or ambulatory treatment (AT) at home. The purpose of this study was to 1) measure functional health (primary outcome) and function relevant factors in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty and to compare them in relation to three postoperative management strategies: AT, Cure and IR and 2) compare the post-operative changes in patient's health status (between preoperative and the 6 month follow-up) for three rehabilitation settings. Methods: Natural observational, prospective two-center study with follow-up. Sociodemographic data and functional mobility tests, Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Iowa Level of Assistance Scale (ILOAS) of 201 patients were analysed before arthroplasty and at the end of acute hospital stay (mean duration of stay: 9.7 days +/- 3.9). Changes in health state were measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) before and 6 months after arthroplasty. Results: Compared to patients referred for IR and Cure, patients referred for AT were significantly younger and less comorbid. Patients admitted to IR had the highest functional disability before arthroplasty. Before rehabilitation, mean TUG was 40.0 s in the IR group, 33.9 s in the Cure group, and 27.5 s in the AT group, and corresponding mean ILOAS was 16.0, 13.0 and 12.2 (50.0 = worst). At the 6 months follow-up, the corresponding effect sizes of the WOMAC global score were 1.32, 1.87, and 1.51 ({$>$}0 means improvement). Conclusions: Age, comorbidity and functional disability are associated with referral for intensive inpatient rehabilitation after hip or knee arthroplasty and partly affect health changes after rehabilitation.},

Design: A prospective intervention study. Setting: University hospital clinic in Germany. Patients: Fifty patients (32 women, 18 men; mean age Ϯ standard deviation, 65.8Ϯ5.6y) with knee OA and 23 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects. Intervention: Unilateral TKA without patella resurfacing. Main Outcome Measures: Voluntary activation, MVC, and true maximal contraction forces of the bilateral quadriceps femoris muscles, using the twitch interpolation technique before and 33Ϯ8 months after TKA. Assessment of postoperative knee pain by the Lewis score. Results: Voluntary activation increased bilaterally after surgery (PϽ.01 operated side, Pϭ.02 nonoperated side) but remained lower than the voluntary activation of the controls. MVC (PϽ.001) and true maximal contraction forces (Pϭ.01) increased significantly on the operated side. MVC remained unchanged (Pϭ.45), and true maximal contraction forces decreased significantly (Pϭ.04) on the nonoperated side. Conclusion: Patients with knee OA have significant bilateral voluntary activation deficits that are, at least in part, reversible within 3 years after TKA. Rehabilitation programs immediately after TKA should focus on reduction of voluntary activation deficits. After voluntary activation improves, physical therapy should target the augmentation of quadriceps femoris muscle strength.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based technique for measuring PF joint motion. Methods: To assess the accuracy of this technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the femur and patella of three cadaveric knee specimens and then recorded dynamic biplane radiographic images while manually flexing and extending the specimen. The position of the femur and patella were measured from the biplane images using both the model-based tracking system and a validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. Model-based tracking was compared to dynamic RSA by computing measures of bias, precision, and overall dynamic accuracy of four clinically-relevant kinematic parameters (patellar shift, flexion, tilt, and rotation). Results: The model-based tracking technique results were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated errors of less than 0.395 mm for patellar shift, 0.875{\textdegree} for flexion, 0.863{\textdegree} for tilt, and 0.877{\textdegree} for rotation. Conclusion: This model-based tracking technique is a non-invasive method for accurately measuring dynamic PF joint motion under in-vivo conditions. The technique is sufficiently accurate in measuring clinically relevant changes in PF joint motion following conservative or surgical treatment.},

  abstract = {Shoulder motion is complex and significant research efforts have focused on measuring glenohumeral joint motion. Unfortunately, conventional motion measurement techniques are unable to measure glenohumeral joint kinematics during dynamic shoulder motion to clinically significant levels of accuracy. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of a new model-based tracking technique for measuring three-dimensional, in vivo glenohumeral joint kinematics. We have developed a model-based tracking technique for accurately measuring in vivo joint motion from biplane radiographic images that tracks the position of bones based on their three-dimensional shape and texture. To validate this technique, we implanted tantalum beads into the humerus and scapula of both shoulders from three cadaver specimens and then recorded biplane radiographic images of the shoulder while manually moving each specimen's arm. The position of the humerus and scapula were measured using the model-based tracking system and with a previously validated dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique. Accuracy was reported in terms of measurement bias, measurement precision, and overall dynamic accuracy by comparing the model-based tracking results to the dynamic RSA results. The model-based tracking technique produced results that were in excellent agreement with the RSA technique. Measurement bias ranged from -0.126to0.199mm for the scapula and ranged from -0.022to0.079mm for the humerus. Dynamic measurement precision was better than 0.130mm for the scapula and 0.095mm for the humerus. Overall dynamic accuracy indicated that rms errors in any one direction were less than 0.385mm for the scapula and less than 0.374mm for the humerus. These errors correspond to rotational inaccuracies of approximately 0.25deg for the scapula and 0.47deg for the humerus. This new model-based tracking approach represents a non-invasive technique for accurately measuring dynamic glenohumeral joint motion under in vivo conditions. The model-based technique achieves accuracy levels that far surpass all previously reported non-invasive techniques for measuring in vivo glenohumeral joint motion. This technique is supported by a rigorous validation study that provides a realistic simulation of in vivo conditions and we fully expect to achieve these levels of accuracy with in vivo human testing. Future research will use this technique to analyze shoulder motion under a variety of testing conditions and to investigate the effects of conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears on dynamic joint stability.},

The algorithm was evaluated using controlled conditions and standard geometries. Results of the validation demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and capability of realizing a pose from a variety of initial poses. Under idealized conditions, poses of a TKA system were recreated to within 0.02{$\pm$}0.01 mm and 0.02{$\pm$}0.03 deg for the femoral component and 0.07{$\pm$}0.09 mm and 0.16{$\pm$}0.18 deg for the tibial component. By employing a standardized geometry with spheres, the translational accuracy and repeatability under actual conditions was found to be 0.01{$\pm$}0.06 mm. Application of the optimized matching algorithm to a TKA patient showed that the pose of in-vivo TKA components can be repeatedly located, with standard deviations less than {$\pm$}0.12 mm and {$\pm$}0.12 deg for the femoral component and {$\pm$}0.29 mm and {$\pm$}0.25 deg for the tibial component. This methodology presents a useful tool that can be readily applied to the investigation of in-vivo motion of TKA kinematics.},

Since registration is an iterative process, fast generation of DRRs{\textemdash}which are perspective summed voxel renderings{\textemdash}is desired. In this note, we present a simple and rapid method for generation of DRRs based on splat rendering. As opposed to conventional splatting, antialiasing of the resulting images is not achieved by means of computing a discrete point spread function (a so-called footprint), but by stochastic distortion of either the voxel positions in the volume scan or by the simulation of a focal spot of the x-ray tube with non-zero diameter.

Currently there is no treatment for FDRC, and many studies have described a natural course for this disease almost always resulting in further degeneration and morbidity. Recapitulating FDRC using animal injury models, and using imaging-based studies of human FDRC, the pathophysiology of this disease continues to be further characterized. Researchers studying mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived progenitor cells and known fibrogenic and adipogenic signaling pathways implicated in FDRC seek to clarify the underlying processes driving these changes. While new cell- and molecular-based therapies are being developed, currently the strongest available avenue for improved management of FDRC is the use of novel imaging techniques which allow for more accurate and personalized staging of FD. This narrative review summarizes the evidence on the molecular and pathophysiologic mechanisms of FDRC and provides a clinical update on the diagnosis and management of this condition based on the existing knowledge. We also sought to examine the role of newer biologic therapies in the management of RC fatty degeneration and to identify areas of future research.},

The establishment of accurate anatomical correspondences is a critical aspect for the construction of reliable models.

The objective of this study was to compare image-based and mesh-based statistical appearance models of the femur for finite element (FE) simulations. To this aim, (i) we compared correspondence detection methods on bone surface and in bone volume; (ii) we created an image-based and a mesh-based statistical appearance models from 130 images, which we validated using compactness, representation and generalization, and we analyzed the FE results on 50 recreated bones vs. original bones; (iii) we created 1000 new instances, and we compared the quality of the FE meshes. Results showed that the image-based approach was more accurate in volume correspondence detection and quality of FE meshes, whereas the mesh-based approach was more accurate for surface correspondence detection and model compactness. Based on our results, we recommend the use of image-based statistical appearance models for FE simulations of the femur.},

  abstract = {There has been recently a growing interest for implicit shape representations. Contrary to explicit representations, they have no resolution limitations and they easily deal with a wide variety of surface topologies. To learn these implicit representations, current approaches rely on a certain level of shape supervision (e.g., inside/outside information or distance-to-shape knowledge), or at least require a dense point cloud (to approximate well enough the distance-to-shape). In contrast, we introduce \{{\textbackslash}method\}, an self-supervised method for learning shape representations from possibly extremely sparse point clouds. Like in Buffon's needle problem, we "drop" (sample) needles on the point cloud and consider that, statistically, close to the surface, the needle end points lie on opposite sides of the surface. No shape knowledge is required and the point cloud can be highly sparse, e.g., as lidar point clouds acquired by vehicles. Previous self-supervised shape representation approaches fail to produce good-quality results on this kind of data. We obtain quantitative results on par with existing supervised approaches on shape reconstruction datasets and show promising qualitative results on hard autonomous driving datasets such as KITTI.},

  abstract = {Objective: Statistical shape models (SSMs) are a popular tool to conduct morphological analysis of anatomical structures which is a crucial step in clinical practices. However, shape representations through SSMs are based on shape coefficients and lack an explicit one-to-one relationship with anatomical measures of clinical relevance. While a shape coefficient embeds a combination of anatomical measures, a formalized approach to find the relationship between them remains elusive in the literature. This limits the use of SSMs to subjective evaluations in clinical practices. We propose a novel SSM controlled by anatomical parameters derived from morphometric analysis. Methods: The proposed anatomically parameterized SSM (ANATSSM) is based on learning a linear mapping between shape coefficients (latent space) and selected anatomical parameters (anatomical space). This mapping is learned from a synthetic population generated by the standard SSM. Determining the pseudo-inverse of the mapping allows us to build the ANATSSM. We further impose orthogonality constraints to the anatomical parameterization (OC-ANATSSM) to obtain independent shape variation patterns. The proposed contribution was evaluated on two skeletal databases of femoral and scapular bone shapes using clinically relevant anatomical parameters within each (five for femoral and six for scapular bone). Results: Anatomical measures of the synthetically generated shapes exhibited realistic statistics. The learned matrices corroborated well with the obtained statistical relationship, while the two SSMs achieved moderate to excellent performance in predicting anatomical parameters on unseen shapes. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the use of anatomical representation for creating anatomically parameterized SSMs and as a result, removes the limited clinical interpretability of standard SSMs. Significance: The proposed models could help analyze differences in relevant bone morphometry between populations, and be integrated in patient-specific pre-surgery planning or in-surgery assessment.},

  abstract = {Kinematics of total knee replacements (TKR) play an important role in assessing the success of a procedure and would be a valuable addition to clinical practice; however, measuring TKR kinematics is time consuming and labour intensive. Recently, an automatic single-plane fluoroscopic method utilizing machine learning has been developed to facilitate a quick and simple process for measuring TKR kinematics. This study aimed to validate the new automatic single-plane technique using biplanar radiostereometric analysis (RSA) as the gold standard. Twenty-four knees were imaged at various angles of flexion in a dedicated RSA lab and 113 image pairs were obtained. Only the lateral RSA images were used for the automatic single-plane technique to simulate single-plane fluoroscopy. Two networks helped automate the kinematics measurement process, one segmented implant components and the other generated an initial pose estimate for the optimization algorithm. Kinematics obtained via the automatic single plane and manual biplane techniques were compared using root-mean-square error and Bland{\textendash}Altman plots. Two observers measured the kinematics using the automated technique and results were compared with assess reproducibility. Root-mean-square errors were 0.8 mm for anterior{\textendash}posterior translation, 0.5 mm for superior{\textendash}inferior translation, 2.6 mm for medial{\textendash}lateral translation, 1.0{\textdegree} for flexion{\textendash}extension, 1.2{\textdegree} for abduction{\textendash}adduction, and 1.7{\textdegree} for internal{\textendash}external rotation. Reproducibility, reported as root-mean-square errors between operator measurements, was submillimeter for in-plane translations and below 2{\textdegree} for all rotations. Clinical Significance: The advantages of the automated single plane technique should aid in the kinematic measurement process and help researchers and clinicians perform TKR kinematic analyses.},

In many applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks, on the scale of billions), and are natural targets for machine learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds.

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

  abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.             Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.  These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,  and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of adipose tissue around and within muscles is highly correlated with reduced strength, functional limitations, and poor rehabilitative outcomes. Given the intimate physical contact between these tissues, paracrine cross-talk is a likely mediator of this association. The recent discovery that muscle-associated adipose tissue exhibits features of beige fat has suggested that this cross-talk may be modifiable, as beige fat can be stimulated to assume features of brown fat. In this work, we describe a novel intermuscular fat transplant model in the mouse rotator cuff to investigate cross-talk between muscle and adipose tissue. Specifically, we examine the role of transplanted fat phenotype on muscle regeneration by transplanting pieces of classical brown (interscapular), beige (inguinal), or white (epididymal) adipose tissue in conjunction with cardiotoxin injection to the adjacent supraspinatus muscle. Transplantation of brown fat, but not beige or white, significantly increased muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area and contractile force production compared with sham injury. This effect was not seen when cardiotoxin was delivered to a distant muscle, or when adjacent muscles were injected with saline indicating that the effect is localized and specifically targeting the regenerative process. Thus, we conclude that local signaling between fat and muscle varies by phenotype and that brown fat supports regeneration. Clinical significance: Our findings suggest that the phenotype of muscle-associated fat could be a novel therapeutic target to modulate fat-muscle signaling. {\textcopyright} 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

But with great power comes great responsibility: there is now a pressing need for new data analysis algorithms to be developed to make sense of the data and transform this information into knowledge which can be directly translated into the clinic. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a promising path forward: using tools from the mathematical field of algebraic topology, TDA provides a framework to extract insights into the often high-dimensional, incomplete, and noisy nature of biomedical data. Nowhere is this more evident than in the field of oncology, where patient-specific data is routinely presented to clinicians in a variety of forms, from imaging to single cell genomic sequencing. In this review, we focus on applications involving persistent homology, one of the main tools of TDA. We describe some recent successes of TDA in oncology, specifically in predicting treatment responses and prognosis, tumor segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis, disease classification, and cellular architecture determination. We also provide suggestions on avenues for future research including utilizing TDA to analyze cancer time-series data such as gene expression changes during pathogenesis, investigation of the relation between angiogenic vessel structure and treatment efficacy from imaging data, and experimental confirmation that geometric and topological connectivity implies functional connectivity in the context of cancer.},

Significant human effort associated with manual tracking presents a major bottleneck in biomechanics research methods and limits the scale of target applications. The current work introduces a method for fully-automatic tracking of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics in stereo-radiography sequences for subjects performing dynamic activities. The proposed method involves the application of convolutional neural networks for annotating radiographs and a multi-stage optimization pipeline for estimating bone pose based on information provided by neural net predictions. Predicted kinematics are evaluated by comparing against manually-tracked trends across 20 distinct trials. Median absolute differences below 1.5millimeters or degrees for 6 tibiofemoral and 3 patellofemoral degrees of freedom demonstrate the utility of our approach, which improves upon previous semi-automatic methods by enabling end-to-end automation. Implementation of a fully-automatic pipeline for kinematic tracking will benefit evaluation of human movement by enabling large-scale studies of healthy knee kinematics.},

  abstract = {The current work introduces a system for fully automatic tracking of native glenohumeral kinematics in stereo-radiography sequences. The proposed method first applies convolutional neural networks to obtain segmentation and semantic key point predictions in biplanar radiograph frames. Preliminary bone pose estimates are computed by solving a non-convex optimization problem with semidefinite relaxations to register digitized bone landmarks to semantic key points. Initial poses are then refined by registering computed tomography-based digitally reconstructed radiographs to captured scenes, which are masked by segmentation maps to isolate the shoulder joint. A particular neural net architecture which exploits subject-specific geometry is also introduced to improve segmentation predictions and increase robustness of subsequent pose estimates. The method is evaluated by comparing predicted glenohumeral kinematics to manually tracked values from 17 trials capturing 4 dynamic activities. Median orientation differences between predicted and ground truth poses were 1.7◦ and 8.6◦ for the scapula and humerus, respectively. Joint-level kinematics differences were less than 2◦ in 65\%, 13\%, and 63\% of frames for XYZ orientation DoFs based on Euler angle decompositions. Automation of kinematic tracking can increase scalability of tracking workflows in research, clinical, or surgical applications.},

In computer vision, image augmentations have become a common implicit regularization technique to combat overfitting in deep learning models and are ubiquitously used to improve performance. While most deep learning frameworks implement basic image transformations, the list is typically limited to some variations of flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Moreover, image processing speed varies in existing image augmentation libraries. We present Albumentations, a fast and flexible open source library for image augmentation with many various image transform operations available that is also an easy-to-use wrapper around other augmentation libraries. We discuss the design principles that drove the implementation of Albumentations and give an overview of the key features and distinct capabilities.

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been been argued for. This thesis is an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture as directly as possible the desirable properties of an edge operator. Variational techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all linear shift invariant operators. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points should b The third criterion is that there should be low probability of more than one response to a single edge. The technique is used to find optimal operators for step edges and for extended impulse profiles (ridges or valleys in two dimensions). The extension of the one dimensional operators to two dimensions is then discussed. The result is a set of operators of varying width, length and orientation. The problem of combining these outputs into a single description is discussed, and a set of heuristics for the integration are given. (Author)},

This work is the first attempt to exploit the enormous power of the GPU in computing the exact EDT, while prior works are only on approximation. Compared to these other algorithms in our experiments, our exact algorithm is still a few times faster in 2D and 3D for most input sizes.

Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

  abstract = {An important feature of modern science and engineering is that data of various kinds is being produced at an unprecedented rate. This is so in part because of new experimental methods, and in part because of the increase in the availability of high powered computing technology. It is also clear that the nature of the data we are obtaining is significantly different. For example, it is now often the case that we are given data in the form of very long vectors, where all but a few of the coordinates turn out to be irrelevant to the questions of interest, and further that we don't necessarily know which coordinates are the interesting ones. A related fact is that the data is often very high-dimensional, which severely restricts our ability to visualize it. The data obtained is also often much noisier than in the past and has more missing information (missing data). This is particularly so in the case of biological data, particularly high throughput data from microarray or other sources. Our ability to analyze this data, both in terms of quantity and the nature of the data, is clearly not keeping pace with the data being produced. In this paper, we will discuss how geometry and topology can be applied to make useful contributions to the analysis of various kinds of data. Geometry and topology are very natural tools to apply in this direction, since geometry can be regarded as the study of distance functions, and what one often works with are distance functions on large finite sets of data. The mathematical formalism which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques deals with point clouds, i.e. finite sets of points equipped with a distance function. It then adapts tools from the various branches of geometry to the study of point clouds. The point clouds are intended to be thought of as finite samples taken from a geometric object, perhaps with noise. Here are some of the key points which come up when applying these geometric methods to data analysis. {\textbullet} Qualitative information is needed: One important goal of data analysis is to allow the user to obtain knowledge about the data, i.e. to understand how it is organized on a large scale. For example, if we imagine that we are looking at a data set constructed somehow from diabetes patients, it would be important to develop the understanding that there are two types of the disease, namely the juvenile and adult onset forms. Once that is established, one of course wants to develop quantitative methods for distinguishing them, but the first insight about the distinct forms of the disease is key.},

We verified intraoperatively (1) if varus/valgus (VV) laxity and anterior/posterior (AP) laxity were restored after TKA; (2) if TKA induced abnormal femoral rollback; and (3) how tibial axial rotation was influenced by TKA throughout the range of flexion. We found that TKA improved alignment in preoperative osteoarthritic varus knees which became neutral after surgery and maintained a neutral alignment in neutral knees. The VV stability at 0{\textdegree} was restored while AP laxity at 90{\textdegree} significantly increased after TKA. Following TKA, the femur had an abnormal anterior translation up to 60{\textdegree} of flexion, followed by a small rollback of 12 {$\pm$} 5 mm. TKA influenced the tibia rotation pattern during flexion, but not the total amount of internal/external rotation throughout whole range of flexion, which was preserved after TKA (6{\textdegree} {$\pm$} 5{\textdegree}). This study showed that the protocol proposed might be useful to adjust knee stability at time zero and that knee kinematic outcome during total knee replacement can be monitored by a navigation system.},

Evidence for polyphenols' effect on obesity and weight control in humans is inconsistent and the health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and their bioavailability. The mechanisms involved in weight loss in which polyphenols may have a role are: activating {$\beta$}-oxidation; a prebiotic effect for gut microbiota; inducing satiety; stimulating energy expenditure by inducing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue; modulating adipose tissue inhibiting adipocyte differentiation; promoting adipocyte apoptosis and increasing lipolysis. Even though the intake of some specific polyphenols has been associated with body weight changes, there is still no evidence for the effects of total polyphenols or some polyphenol subclasses in humans on adiposity.},

  abstract = {Background. The Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) is a relatively new balance assessment tool. Recently, the Mini-BESTest and the Brief-BESTest, which are shortened versions of the BESTest, were developed. Objective. The purpose of this study was to estimate interrater and intraraterinteroccasion reliability, internal consistency, concurrent and convergent validity, and floor and ceiling effects of the 3 BESTests and other related measures, namely, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, among patients with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Design. This was an observational measurement study. Methods. To establish interrater reliability, the 3 BESTests were administered by 3 independent raters to 25 participants with TKA. Intrarater-interoccasion reliability was evaluated in 46 participants with TKA (including the 25 individuals who participated in the interrater reliability experiments) by repeating the 3 BESTests, BBS, and FGA within 1 week by the same rater. Internal consistency of each test also was assessed with Cronbach alpha. Validity was assessed in another 46 patients with TKA by correlating the 3 BESTests with BBS, FGA, and ABC. The floor and ceiling effects also were examined. A.C.M. Chan, MSc, Physiotherapy Department, Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital, 10 Heng Lam St, Lok Fu Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The 3 BESTests demonstrated excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] [2,1]ϭ.96 {\textendash}.99), intrarater-interoccasion reliability (ICC [2,1]ϭ.92{\textendash}.96), and internal consistency (Cronbach alphaϭ.96 {\textendash}.98). These values were comparable to those for the BBS and FGA. The 3 BESTests also showed moderate-to-strong correlations with the BBS, FGA, and ABC (rϭ.35{\textendash}.81), thus demonstrating good concurrent and convergent validity. No significant floor and ceiling effects were observed, except for the BBS. Limitations. The results are generalizable only to patients with TKA due to end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Conclusions. The 3 BESTests have good reliability and validity for evaluating balance in people with TKA. The Brief-BESTest is the least time-consuming and may be more useful clinically.},

MLPE was extracted from mulberry leaves using ethanol, and those polyphenolic compounds that can be analysed by HPLC. Both MLE and MLPE efficiently suppressed the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-{$\gamma$} proteins and the target genes A-FABP and FAS, whereas both of these compounds increased phosphorylation of AMPK in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of quercetin, caffeic acid, hydroxyflavin and hesperetin, the main ingredients of MLPE, also inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In addition, orally administering MLE significantly reduced body weight gain and lipid accumulation in the liver and serum/hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol levels compared with those in the HFD group. Therefore, the mulberry leaf may be used as a dietary supplement in patients with certain diseases with obesity involvement.},

Screening for ROIs is a tedious and timeconsuming visual recognition task which can be exhausting. The cognitive workload could be reduced by developing a visual aid to narrow down the visual search area by highlighting (or segmenting) regions of diagnostic relevance, enabling pathologists to spend more time diagnosing relevant ROIs. In this paper, we propose HistoSegNet, a method for semantic segmentation of histological tissue type (HTT). Using the HTT-annotated Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP) database, we train a Convolutional Neural Network on the patch annotations, infer Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps, average overlapping predictions, and postprocess the segmentation with a fully-connected Conditional Random Field. Our method out-performs more complicated weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods and can generalize to other datasets without retraining.},

The lack of such information for the elbow has motivated the present study. An attempt is therefore made to measure the rotatory component of cadaver elbows under passive motion. The results obtained will be used to Justify certain noninvasive means to measure three-dimensional angular motion for hving subjects. Using biplanar radiographs, cadaver forearms were studied under the passive motions of flexion-extensIOn and supination-pronation. The coordmate axes for the forearm, radius and ulna were defined based on imbedded Kirschner wires The three-dimensional rotation of the forearm with respect to the humerus, as well as the relative motion among the radius, ulna and humerus, were analyzed based on Eulerian angles. The relationship between the primary modes of motion and the inherent secondary motion was defined and analyzed. No translatIOnal motion within the joint was considered because of the tight constraint of the ligamentous structure. However, this hypothesis was exammed by momtoring the vanation of the displacement of the moving coordmate center The implications of these findings to the surgical treatment of elbow problems were speculated on.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

We developed an objective and robust deep learning-based fully-automated tool called the DeepPET-OPSCC biomarker for predicting overall survival (OS) in OPSCC using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging.  Experimental design  The DeepPET-OPSCC prediction model was built and tested internally on a discovery cohort (n = 268) by integrating five convolutional neural network models for volumetric segmentation and ten models for OS prognostication. Two external test cohorts were enrolled - the first based on the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database (n = 353) and the second being a clinical deployment cohort (n = 31) - to assess the DeepPET-OPSCC performance and goodness of fit.  Results  After adjustment for potential confounders, DeepPET-OPSCC was found to be an independent predictor of OS in both discovery and TCIA test cohorts (HR = 2.07; 95\% CI 1.31-3.28 and HR = 2.39; 1.38-4.16; both P = 0.002). The tool also revealed good predictive performance, with a c-index of 0.707 (95\% CI 0.658-0.757) in the discovery cohort, 0.689 (0.621-0.757) in the TCIA test cohort, and 0.787 (0.675-0.899) in the clinical deployment test cohort; the average time taken was 2 min for calculation per exam. The integrated nomogram of DeepPET-OPSCC and clinical risk factors significantly outperformed the clinical model (AUC at 5 years: 0.801 [95\% CI 0.727-0.874] versus 0.749 [0.649-0.842]; P = 0.031) in the TCIA test cohort.  Conclusions  DeepPET-OPSCC achieved an accurate OS prediction in patients with OPSCC and enabled an objective, unbiased, and rapid assessment for OPSCC prognostication.},

Results demonstrated similar physiological changes in mice treated with LEO and S-(+)-linalool, but significantly different effects in the body weight, TG, TC and blood glucose of R-(-)-linalool group. S-(+)-linalool-treated mice gained less weight and had significant decrease in blood triglyceride levels. No histopathological changes were observed in livers, kidneys, and spleens of S-(+)-linalool-treated mice. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels between S-(+)-linalool-treated mice and the control group.

Existing methods mainly rely on a variety of constraints to achieve the pose transfer over 3D meshes, e.g., the need for manually encoding for shape and pose disentanglement. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to conduct the pose transfer between any arbitrate given 3D meshes. Specifically, a novel Intrinsic-Extrinsic Preserved Generative Adversarial Network (IEP-GAN) is presented for both intrinsic (i.e., shape) and extrinsic (i.e., pose) information preservation. Extrinsically, we propose a co-occurrence discriminator to capture the structural/pose invariance from distinct Laplacians of the mesh. Meanwhile, intrinsically, a local intrinsic-preserved loss is introduced to preserve the geodesic priors while avoiding heavy computations. At last, we show the possibility of using IEP-GAN to manipulate 3D human meshes in various ways, including pose transfer, identity swapping and pose interpolation with latent code vector arithmetic. The extensive experiments on various 3D datasets of humans, animals and hands qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the generality of our approach. Our proposed model produces better results and is substantially more efficient compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. Code is available: https://github.com/mikecheninoulu/Unsupervised\_IEPGAN},

However, only very limited data have been obtained regarding the effects of resveratrol on preadipocytes, and the mechanisms of these effects remain largely unknown. In this study, murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated with resveratrol, and cell apoptosis was investigated. Resveratrol caused S-phase arrest to inhibit cell proliferation and significantly increased the lactate dehydrogenase leaking ratio. Hoechst 33258 staining and transmission electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructural changes in nuclear chromatins of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, resveratrol activated the mitochondrial signaling with decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Resveratrol treatment also increased the protein level of Sirt1. By using small interfering RNAs of Sirt1, adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) {$\alpha$}, survivin and the AMPK agonist (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-{$\beta$}-D-ribofuranoside) and specific inhibitors for protein kinase B (AKT) or caspases, it was demonstrated that activation of Sirt1 inhibited AKT activation and further decreased the expression of survivin. It could also increase AMPK activation. Both signaling pathways activated mitochondrion-mediated pathway. Our findings clarified the apoptotic effects of resveratrol in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and revealed the involved pathway including AMPK, AKT and survivin, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in the treatment or prevention of obesity and related metabolic symptoms.},

  abstract = {Chronic inter-limb joint mechanical asymmetry has been reported following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) during low-demand mobility tasks such as level walking. However, no study has compared the inter-limb asymmetry during a high-demand mobility task such as decline walking. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare inter-limb asymmetry differences during both level and decline walking tasks at six months following TKA compared to asymmetry present in an age, gender, body mass index and activity level matched healthy cohort. Kinetic and kinematic gait analysis was conducted on 42 patients with TKA and 15 healthy-matched peers. Our inter-limb asymmetry results demonstrated significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) greater combined limb support moment (MS) (mean differences [MD] = 0.17; 95\% CI = 0.07, 0.22), knee extensor moment (MK) (MD = 0.05; 95\% CI = 0.02, 0.09) and vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) (MD = 0.03; 95\% CI = 0.01, 0.08) differences during decline walking compared to level walking in patients with TKA. Greater MS (MD = 0.24; 95\% CI = 0.13, 0.35), MK (MD = 0.08; 95\% CI = 0.03, 0.18), vGRF (MD = 0.04; 95\% CI = 0.01, 0.08) and knee joint angle (MD = 2.4; 95\% CI = 0.37, 3.80) differences were present in patients with TKA compared to healthy-matched peers during decline walking. Greater MS (MD = 0.13; 95\% CI = 0.05, 0.20) and plantarflexor moment (MD = 0.06; 95\% CI = 0.04, 0.16) differences were present in patients with TKA compared to healthy-matched peers during level walking. Post-TKA inter-limb asymmetry during level walking worsens as the physical demands of the task are increased. Thus, even patients with good self-reported outcomes after TKA exhibit substantial deficits in their mobility reserves that could limit their independence and community mobility as they age.},

Contributing to its widespread adoption are the understandable and intuitive nature of the task, the relatively small size and storage requirements and the accessibility and ease-of-use of the database itself. The MNIST database was derived from a larger dataset known as the NIST Special Database 19 which contains digits, uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters. This paper introduces a variant of the full NIST dataset, which we have called Extended MNIST (EMNIST), which follows the same conversion paradigm used to create the MNIST dataset. The result is a dataset that constitutes a more challenging classification task involving letters and digits, and one that shares the same image structure and parameters as the original MNIST task, allowing for direct compatibility with all existing classifiers and systems. Benchmark results using an online ELM algorithm are presented along with a validation of the conversion process through the comparison of the classification results on NIST digits and the MNIST digits.},

  abstract = {Obesity is the actual worldwide health threat, that is associated with an increased number of metabolic disorders and diseases. Following the traditional hypothesis stating that in obesity hypertrophic adipocytes trigger the adipose tissue hyperplasia, strategies to treat obesity have increased fat researches of the molecular processes that achieve adipocyte enlargement and formation that finally increase body fat mass. Moreover, a new cell type was recently identified, the ``brite'' adipocyte that presents a unique gene expression profile of compared to both brown and white adipocytes. Therapies against obesity, targeting these cells and their pathways, would include the induction of lipolysis and apoptosis or the inhibition of differentiation and adipogenesis. However, it should be noted that both the increase of adipocyte size and number take place in association with positive energy balance. According to the adipose tissue expansion hypothesis, adipogenesis could be related with improved metabolic health of obese people, taking back the adipose mass to a traditionally site of lipid storage. Furthermore, new perspectives in fat biology suggest that the conversion of white-to-brown adipocytes and their metabolism could be exploited for the development of therapeutic approaches against obesity-associated diseases and for the regulation of energy balance. Drugs currently available to treat obesity generally have unpleasant side effects. A novel promising approach is the usage of dietary supplements and plant products that could interfere on the life cycle of adipocyte. Here, various dietary bioactive compounds that target different stages of adipocyte life cycle and molecular and metabolic pathways are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2014 BioFactors, 40(4):398{\textendash}418, 2014},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of pathological shoulder muscles in patients with musculo-skeletal diseases is a challenging task due to the huge variability in muscle shape, size, location, texture and injury. A reliable fully-automated segmentation method from magnetic resonance images could greatly help clinicians to plan therapeutic interventions and predict interventional outcomes while eliminating time consuming manual segmentation efforts. The purpose of this work is three-fold. First, we investigate the feasibility of pathological shoulder muscle segmentation using deep learning techniques, given a very limited amount of available annotated pediatric data. Second, we address the learning transferability from healthy to pathological data by comparing different learning schemes in terms of model generalizability. Third, extended versions of deep convolutional encoder-decoder architectures using encoders pre-trained on non-medical data are proposed to improve the segmentation accuracy. Methodological aspects are evaluated in a leave-one-out fashion on a dataset of 24 shoulder examinations from patients with obstetrical brachial plexus palsy and focus on 4 different muscles including deltoid as well as infraspinatus, supraspinatus and subscapularis from the rotator cuff. The most relevant segmentation model is partially pre-trained on ImageNet and jointly exploits inter-patient healthy and pathological annotated data. Its performance reaches Dice scores of 82.4\%, 82.0\%, 71.0\% and 82.8\% for deltoid, infraspinatus, supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles. Absolute surface estimation errors are all below 83mm\$\^2\$ except for supraspinatus with 134.6mm\$\^2\$. These contributions offer new perspectives for force inference in the context of musculo-skeletal disorder management.},

An initial estimate of the location of the model points in an image is improved by attempting to move each point to a better position nearby. Adjustments to the pose variables and shape para meters are calculated. Limits are placed on the shape parameters ensur ing that the example can only deform into shapes conforming to global constraints imposed by the training set. An iterative procedure deforms the model example to find the best fit to the image object. Results of ap plying the method are described.

A total knee implant was installed on sawbones and a flexion extension movement was performed with the sagittal plane parallel to the detector panel of the fluoroscope. Simultaneously, the sawbones were tracked using a conventional motion tracking system and rigidly attached markers. That measurement can be seen as a golden standard and is therefore believed to represent the real positions.},

  abstract = {B-type glenoids are characterized by posterior humeral head migration and/or bonyerosion-induced glenoid retroversion. Patients with this type of osteoarthritic glenoids are known to be at increased risk of glenoid component loosening after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA). One of the main challenges in B glenoid surgical planning is to find a balance between correcting the bony shape and maintaining the quality of the bone support. This study aims to systematically quantify variabilities in terms of scapular morphology and bone mineral density in patients with B glenoids and to identify patterns of covariation between these two features. Using computed tomography scan images of 62 patients, three-dimensional scapular surface models were constructed. Rigid and nonrigid surface registration of the scapular surfaces, followed by volumetric registration and material mapping, enabled us to develop statistical shape model (SSM) and statistical density model (SDM). Partial least square correlation (PLSC) was used to identify patterns of covariation. The developed SSM and SDM represented 85.9\% and 56.6\% of variabilities in terms of scapular morphology and bone density, respectively. PLSC identified four modes of covariation, explaining 66.0\% of the correlation between these two variations. Covariation of posterior{\textendash}inferior glenoid erosion with posterior sclerotic bone formation in association with reduction of bone density in the anterior and central part of the glenoid was detected as the primary mode of covariation. Identification of these asymmetrical distribution of bone density can inform us about possible reasons behind glenoid component loosening in B glenoids and surgical guidelines in terms of the compromise between bony shape correction and bone support quality.},

  abstract = {Purpose. A new technique for analyzing the morphology of the corpus callosum is presented, and it is applied to a group of elderly subjects. Methods. The proposed approach normalizes subject data into the Talairach space using an elastic deformation transformation. The properties of this transformation are used as a quantitative description of the callosal shape with respect to the Talairach atlas, which is treated as a standard. In particular, a deformation function measures the enlargement/shrinkage associated with this elastic deformation. Inter-subject comparisons are made by comparing deformation functions. Results. This technique was applied to eight male and eight female subjects. Based on the average deformation functions of each group, the posterior region of the female corpus callosum was found to be larger than its corresponding region in the males. The average callosal shape of each group was also found, demonstrating visually the callosal shape di erences between the two groups in this sample. Conclusion. The proposed methodology utilizes the full resolution of the data, rather than relying on global descriptions such as area measurements. The application of this methodology to an elderly group indicated sex-related di erences in the callosal shape and size.},

The tibiofemoral contact point (CP) moves anteriorly and produces a decrease in the lever arm of the extensor apparatus. This can provoke patellofemoral, tibiofemoral-joint pain and instability for the patient. In order to quantify the amount of paradoxical motion on a 90{\textdegree} flexion radiograph of the knee, the average normal CP of the natural knee should be known. There are no known CP measurement methods suited for natural knees and knees with TKR that can be applied in daily practice, and only estimations for the CP position have been made. Therefore, a CP measurement technique on lateral radiographs that can be applied to natural knees and knees with a TKR has been developed. The reproducibility of this method was assessed. It was then used to determine the normal range of the CP in natural knees. The medial contact point in the natural knee in 90{\textdegree} of flexion was determined to be at 68\% ({$\pm$}6.6\%) of the AP diameter of the tibia measured below the tibia-plateau simulating a bone resection with TKR. This reproducible CP measurement method can be used clinically to evaluate the CP after knee prosthesis and also in patients with suspected ligament lesions.},

Patient-specific bone models were derived from computed tomography (CT) data. 3D computer bone models of each subject's femur, tibia, and fibula were recreated from the CT 3D bone density data. Using a model-based 3D-to-2D imaging technique registered CT images were precisely fit onto fluoroscopic images, the full six degrees of freedom motion of the bones was measured from the images. The computer-generated 3D models of each subject's femur and tibia were precisely registered to the 2D digital fluoroscopic images using an optimization algorithm that automatically adjusts the pose of the model at various flexion/extension angles. Each subject performed a weightbearing deep knee bend while under dynamic fluoroscopic surveillance. All 10 normal knees experienced posterior femoral translation of the lateral condyle and minimal change in position of the medial condyle with progressive knee flexion. The average amount of posterior femoral translation of the lateral condyle was 21.07 mm, whereas the average medial condyle translation was 1.94 mm, in the posterior direction. In contrast, all five ACLD knees experienced considerable change in the position of the medial condyle. The average amount of posterior femoral translation of the lateral condyle was 17.00 mm, while the medial condyle translation was 4.65 mm, in the posterior direction. In addition, the helical axis of motion was determined between maximum flexion and extension. A considerable difference was found between the center of rotation locations of the normal and ACLD subjects, with ACLD subjects exhibiting substantially higher variance in kinematic patterns.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {Recent advances in programming languages for graphics processing units (GPUs) provide developers with a convenient way of implementing applications which can be executed on the CPU and GPU interchangeably. GPUs are becoming relatively cheap, powerful, and widely available hardware components, which can be used to perform intensive calculations. The last decade of hardware performance developments shows that GPU-based computation is progressing significantly faster than CPU-based computation, particularly if one considers the execution of highly parallelisable algorithms. Future predictions illustrate that this trend is likely to continue. In this paper, we introduce a way of accelerating 2-D/3-D image registration by developing a hybrid system which executes on the CPU and utilizes the GPU for parallelizing the generation of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Based on the advancements of the GPU over the CPU, it is timely to exploit the benefits of many-core GPU technology by developing algorithms for DRR generation. Although some previous work has investigated the rendering of DRRs using the GPU, this paper investigates approximations which reduce the computational overhead while still maintaining a quality consistent with that needed for 2-D/3-D registration with sufficient accuracy to be clinically acceptable in certain applications of radiation oncology. Furthermore, by comparing implementations of 2-D/3-D registration on the CPU and GPU, we investigate current performance and propose an optimal framework for PC implementations addressing the rigid registration problem. Using this framework, we are able to render DRR images from a   \$256{\textbackslash}times 256{\textbackslash}times 133\$    CT volume in   \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}24\$   ms using an NVidia GeForce 8800 GTX and in   \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2\$   ms using NVidia GeForce GTX 580. In addition to applications requiring fast automatic patient setup, these levels of performance suggest image-guided radiation therapy at video frame rates is technically feasible using relatively low cost PC architecture.},

  abstract = {While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

The equality constraints are assumed to implicitly define a Lipschitz manifold. Numerically implementing the inverse (implicit) function theorem allows us to define a new problem on the tangent spaces of the manifold. We can then use a direct search method on the tangent spaces to solve the new optimization problem without any equality constraints. Solving this related problem implicitly solves the original optimization problem. Our main example utilizes the LTMADS algorithm for the direct search method. However, other direct search methods can be employed. Convergence results trivially carry over to our new procedure under mild assumptions.},

Indeed bony structures between different patient images, such as vertebras, may rigidly move while other tissues may deform. The method is divided into 3 steps. The method first registers the articulated rigid bodies together. Then it propagates the deformation into the whole volume through the use of a tetrahedral mesh and it finishes the registration using a mutual information based optical flow. Following the ITK framework, it uses a fast stochastic gradient descent optimization strategy chosen to maximize the mutual information metric. We demonstrate this method provides accurate results on 3D CT, MR and PET images.},

The method estimates an anatomical model, the template complex, that is representative of the population under study. Its shape reflects anatomical invariants within the dataset. In addition, the method automatically places control points near the most variable parts of the template complex. Vectors attached to these points are parameters of deformations of the ambient 3D space. These deformations warp the template to each subject's complex in a way that preserves the organization of the anatomical structures. Multivariate statistical analysis is applied to these deformation parameters to test for group di↵erences. Results of the statistical analysis are then expressed in terms of deformation patterns of the template complex, and can be visualized and interpreted. The user needs only to specify the topology of the template complex and the number of control points. The method then automatically estimates the shape of the template complex, the optimal position of control points and deformation parameters. The proposed approach is completely generic with respect to any type of application and well adapted to e cient use in clinical studies, in that it does not require point correspondence across surfaces and is robust to mesh imperfections such as holes, spikes, inconsistent orientation or irregular meshing.},

Dietary polyphenols may suppress growth of adipose tissue through their antiangiogenic activity and by modulating adipocyte metabolism. We investigated the effect of curcumin, the major polyphenol in turmeric spice, on angiogenesis, adipogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene expression involved in lipid and energy metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocyte in cell culture systems and on body weight gain and adiposity in mice fed a high-fat diet (22\%) supplemented with 500 mg curcumin/kg diet for 12 wk. Curcumin (5-20 {$\mu$}mol/L) suppressed 3T3-L1 differentiation, caused apoptosis, and inhibited adipokine-induced angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Supplementing the high-fat diet of mice with curcumin did not affect food intake but reduced body weight gain, adiposity, and microvessel density in adipose tissue, which coincided with reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR-2. Curcumin increased 5'AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, reduced glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase-1, and increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 expression, which led to increased oxidation and decreased fatty acid esterification. The in vivo effect of curcumin on the expression of these enzymes was also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, curcumin significantly lowered serum cholesterol and expression of PPAR{$\gamma$} and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a, 2 key transcription factors in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. The curcumin suppression of angiogenesis in adipose tissue together with its effect on lipid metabolism in adipocytes may contribute to lower body fat and body weight gain. Our findings suggest that dietary curcumin may have a potential benefit in preventing obesity.},

  abstract = {Distance transform (DT) and Voronoi diagrams (VDs) have found many applications in image analysis. Euclidean distance transform (EDT) can generate forms that do not vary with the rotation, because it is radially symmetrical, which is a desirable characteristic in distance transform applications. Recently, parallel architectures have been very accessible and, particularly, GPU-based architectures are very promising due to their high performance, low power consumption and affordable prices. In this paper, a new parallel algorithm is proposed for the computation of a Euclidean distance map and Voronoi diagram of a binary image that mixes CUDA multi-thread parallel image processing with a raster propagation of distance information over small fragments of the image. The basic idea is to exploit the throughput and the latency in each level of memory in the NVIDIA GPU; the image is set in the global memory, and can be accessed via texture memory, and we divide the problem into blocks of threads. For each block we copy a portion of the image and each thread applies a raster scan-based algorithm to a tile of m {\texttimes} m pixels. Experiment results exhibit that our proposed GPU algorithm can improve the efficiency of the Euclidean distance transform in most cases, obtaining speedup factors that even reach 3.193.},

  abstract = {Fluoroscopic imaging has become increasingly popular to investigate total knee arthroplasty kinematics non-invasively {\`A} 3D implant models are aligned with 2D image projections, and optimized via an edgecontour alignment technique. Previous studies have quantified the accuracy of this approach, however they do not always adequately address the impact of image collection parameters. A particularly sensitive parameter is the pulse width, or exposure time per frame. At longer pulse widths, more motion is captured in a single frame; this can lead to image blur and subsequent degradation to image edge quality. Therefore, the comparative accuracy of relative joint kinematics as a function of pulse width and joint velocity needs to be defined. A limits of agreement approach was taken to define the mean differences between optoelectric kinematic measures (gold standard) and fluoroscopic methods at various pulse widths (1, 8 and 16 ms) and knee velocities (50, 100 and 225{\textdegree}/s). The mean absolute differences between the optoelectric and fluoroscopic methods for 1 ms pulse width were less than 1.5{\textdegree} and 0.9 mm. Comparable rotational differences (1.3{\textdegree}) were observed for the 8 ms pulse width but had larger translational differences (1.4 mm). The 16 ms pulse width yielded the greatest mean differences (2.0{\textdegree} and 1.6 mm), which increased with knee flexion velocity. The importance of pulse width and velocity should not be overlooked for future studies {\textendash} this parameter has proven to be a sensitive metric in the quantification of joint motion via fluoroscopy and must be identified and reported in future studies.},

These works point to a future where such systems will be used to generate lead molecules, greatly reducing resources spent downstream synthesizing and characterizing bad leads in the lab. In this review we survey the increasingly complex landscape of models and representation schemes that have been proposed. The four classes of techniques we describe are recursive neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. After first discussing some of the mathematical fundamentals of each technique, we draw high level connections and comparisons with other techniques and expose the pros and cons of each. Several important high level themes emerge as a result of this work, including the shift away from the SMILES string representation of molecules towards more sophisticated representations such as graph grammars and 3D representations, the importance of reward function design, the need for better standards for benchmarking and testing, and the benefits of adversarial training and reinforcement learning over maximum likelihood based training.},

This study identified sagittal implant position which may predict improved outcomes using machine learning algorithms. Methods: A retrospective review of 1091 consecutive TKAs was performed. All TKAs were posterior cruciate ligament retaining or sacrificing with an anterior-lip (49.4\%) or conforming bearing (50.6\%) and performed with modern perioperative protocols. Preoperative and postoperative tibial slope and postoperative femoral component flexion were measured with standardized radiographic protocols. Analysis groups were categorized by satisfaction scores and the Knee Society Score question `does this knee feel normal to you?' Machine learning algorithms were used to identify optimal sagittal alignment zones that predict superior satisfaction and knees ``always feeling normal'' scores. Results: Mean age and median body mass index were 66 years and 34 kg/m2, respectively, with 67\% being female. The machine learning model predicted an increased likelihood of being ``satisfied or very satisfied'' and a knee ``always feeling normal'' with a change in tibial slope closer to native ({\`A}2 to {\th}2 ) and femoral component flexion 0 to {\th}7 . Worse outcomes were predicted with any femoral component extension, femoral component flexion beyond {\th}10 , and adding or removing {$>$}5  of native tibial slope. Conclusion: Superior patient-reported outcomes were predicted with approximating native tibial slope and incorporating some femoral component flexion. Deviation from native tibial slope and excessive femoral flexion or any femoral component extension were predictive of worse outcomes.},

Methods: Dynamic stereo X-ray was used to quantify tibiofemoral joint contact mechanics and frontal-plane motion during the loading response phase of downhill gait in 11 patients with knee OA and 11 control volunteers. Quantitative testing of the quadriceps and the hip abductor muscles was also performed. Results: Patients with knee OA demonstrated larger medial/lateral joint contact point excursions (p b 0.02) and greater heel-strike joint contact point velocities (p b 0.05) for the medial and lateral compartments compared to the control group. The peak medial/lateral joint contact point velocity of the medial compartment was also greater for patients with knee OA compared to their control counterparts (p = 0.02). Additionally, patients with knee OA demonstrated significantly increased frontal-plane varus motion excursions (p b 0.01) and greater quadriceps and hip abductor muscle weakness (p = 0.03). In general, increased joint contact point excursions and velocities in patients with knee OA were linearly associated with greater frontal-plane varus motion excursions (p b 0.04) but not with quadriceps or hip abductor strength.

While so far these assumptions have only been evaluated for simplified point-mass or planar models, we address the question of whether they can predict reaching movements in a full skeletal model of the human upper extremity. We learn a control policy using a motor babbling approach as implemented in reinforcement learning, using aimed movements of the tip of the right index finger towards randomly placed 3D targets of varying size. We use a state-of-the-art biomechanical model, which includes seven actuated degrees of freedom. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we use a simplified second-order muscle model, acting at each degree of freedom instead of individual muscles. The results confirm that the assumptions of signal-dependent and constant motor noise, together with the objective of movement time minimization, are sufficient for a state-of-the-art skeletal model of the human upper extremity to reproduce complex phenomena of human movement, in particular Fitts' Law and the                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}frac\{2\}\{3\}\$\$                                                               2                       3                                                                                       Power Law.

Researchers have investigated the influence of articular geometry on kinematics and contact mechanics in order to gain insight into the etiology of these conditions. The purpose of the current study was to create a three-dimensional statistical shape model of the PF joint and to characterize relationships between PF shape and function (kinematics and contact mechanics). A statistical shape model of the patellar and femoral articular surfaces and their relative alignment was developed from magnetic resonance images. Using 15 shape parameters, the model characterized 97\% of the variation in the training set. The first three shape modes primarily described variation in size, patella alta{\textendash}baja and depth of the sulcus groove. A previously verified finite element model was used to predict kinematics and contact mechanics for each subject. Combining the shape and joint mechanics data, a statistical shape{\textendash}function model was developed that established quantitative relations of how changes in the shape of the PF joint influence mechanics. The predictive capability of the shape{\textendash}function model was evaluated by comparing statistical model and finite element predictions, resulting in kinematic root mean square errors of less than 3{\textdegree} and 2.5mm. The key results of the study are dually in the implementation of a novel approach linking statistical shape and finite element models and the relationships elucidated between PF articular geometry and mechanics.},

A standard technique for computing such descriptions is principal component analysis. However, principal component analysis is limited in that it only works for data lying in a Euclidean vector space. While this is certainly sufficient for geometric models that are parameterized by a set of landmarks or a dense collection of boundary points, it does not handle more complex representations of shape. We have been developing representations of geometry based on the medial axis description or m-rep. While the medial representation provides a rich language for variability in terms of bending, twisting, and widening, the medial parameters are not elements of a Euclidean vector space. They are in fact elements of a nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. In this paper we develop the method of principal geodesic analysis, a generalization of principal component analysis to the manifold setting. We demonstrate its use in describing the variability of medially-defined anatomical objects. Results of applying this framework on a population of hippocampi in a schizophrenia study are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for reconstruction of 3D shapes using a few x-ray views and a statistical model. In many applications of surgery such as orthopedics, it is desirable to define a surgical planning on 3-D images and then to execute the plan using standard registration techniques and image-guided surgery systems. But the cost, time and x-ray dose associated with standard pre-operative Computed Tomography makes it difficult to use this methodology for rather standard interventions. Instead, we propose to use a few x-ray images generated from a C-Arm and to build the 3-D shape of the patient bones or organs intra-operatively, by deforming a statistical 3-D model to the contours segmented on the x-ray views. In this paper, we concentrate on the application of our method to bone reconstruction. The algorithm starts from segmented contours of the bone on the x-ray images and an initial estimate of the pose of the 3-D model in the common coordinate system of the set of x-ray projections. The statistical model is made of a few principal modes that are sufficient to represent the normal anatomy. Those modes are built by using a generalization of the Cootes and Taylor method to 3-D surface models, previously published in MICCAI'98 by the authors. Fitting the model to the contours is achieved by using a generalization of the Iterative Closest Point Algorithm to nonrigid 3D/2D registration. For pathological shapes, the statistical model is not valid and subsequent local refinement is necessary. First results are presented for a 3-D statistical model of the distal part of the femur.},

  abstract = {This review describes the anatomy of the articular surfaces and their movement in the normal tibio-femoral joint, together with methods of measurement in volunteers. Forces and soft tissues are excluded. To measure movement, the articular surfaces and natural or inserted movement markers must be imaged by some combination of MRI, CT, RSA or fluoroscopy. With the aid of computer-imaging, the movements can then be related to an anatomy-based co-ordinate system to avoid kinematic cross-talk. Methods of depicting these movements which are understandable to engineers and clinicians are discussed. The shapes of the articular surfaces are reported. They are relevant to landmarks and co-ordinate systems and form a basis for inferring the nature of the movements which take place in the knee. The movements of the condyles are described from hyperextension to full passive flexion. Medially the condyle hardly moves antero-posteriorly from 0  to 120  but the contact area transfers from an anterior pair of tibio-femoral surfaces at 10  to a posterior pair at about 30 . Thus because of the shapes of the bones, the medial contact area moves backwards with flexion to 30  but the condyle does not. Laterally the femoral condyle and the contact area move posteriorly but to a variable extent in the mid-range causing tibial internal rotation to occur with flexion around a medial axis. From 120  to full flexion both condyles roll back onto the posterior horn so that the tibio-femoral joint subluxes.},

  abstract = {Wear of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bearings in total knee replacements remains a major limitation to the longevity of these clinically successful devices. Few design tools are currently available to predict mild wear in implants based on varying kinematics, loads, and material properties. This paper reports the implementation of a computer modeling approach that uses fluoroscopically measured motions as inputs and predicts patient-specific implant damage using computationally efficient dynamic contact and tribological analyses. Multibody dynamic simulations of two activities (gait and stair) with two loading conditions (70{\textendash}30 and 50{\textendash}50 medial{\textendash}lateral load splits) were generated from fluoroscopic data to predict contact pressure and slip velocity time histories for individual elements on the tibial insert surface. These time histories were used in a computational wear analysis to predict the depth of damage due to wear and creep experienced by each element. Predicted damage areas, volumes, and maximum depths were evaluated against a tibial insert retrieved from the same patient who provided the in vivo motions. Overall, the predicted damage was in close agreement with damage observed on the retrieval. The gait and stair simulations separately predicted the correct location of maximum damage on the lateral side, whereas a combination of gait and stair was required to predict the correct location on the medial side. Predicted maximum damage depths were consistent with the retrieval as well. Total computation time for each damage prediction was less than 30 min. Continuing refinement of this approach will provide a robust tool for accurately predicting clinically relevant wear in total knee replacements.},

  abstract = {Fractures of the proximal femur are one of the principal causes of mortality among elderly persons. Traditional methods for the determination of femoral fracture risk use methods for measuring bone mineral density. However, BMD alone is not sufficient to predict bone failure load for an individual patient and additional parameters have to be determined for this purpose. In this work an approach that uses statistical models of appearance to identify relevant regions and parameters for the prediction of biomechanical properties of the proximal femur will be presented. By using Support Vector Regression the proposed model based approach is capable of predicting two different biomechanical parameters accurately and fully automatically in two different testing scenarios.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND This study aimed to assess the utility of deep learning analysis using pretreatment FDG-PET images to predict local treatment outcome in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients. METHODS One hundred fifty-four OPSCC patients who received pretreatment FDG-PET were included and divided into training (n=102) and test (n=52) sets. The diagnosis of local failure and local progression-free survival (PFS) rates were obtained from patient medical records. In deep learning analyses, axial and coronal images were assessed by three different architectures (AlexNet, GoogLeNET, and ResNet). In the training set, FDG-PET images were analyzed after the data augmentation process for the diagnostic model creation. A multivariate clinical model was also created using a binomial logistic regression model from a patient's clinical characteristics. The test data set was subsequently analyzed for confirmation of diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of local PFS rates was also performed. RESULTS Training sessions were successfully performed with an accuracy of 74-89\%. ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC of 0.61-0.85 by the deep learning model in the test set, whereas it was 0.62 by T-stage, 0.59 by clinical stage, and 0.74 by a multivariate clinical model. The highest AUC (0.85) was obtained with deep learning analysis of ResNet architecture. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed deep learning-based classification by a multivariate clinical model (P{$<$}.05), and ResNet (P{$<$}.001) was a significant predictor of the treatment outcome. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the deep learning-based classification divided the patient's local PFS rate better than the T-stage, clinical stage, and a multivariate clinical model. CONCLUSIONS Deep learning-based diagnostic model with FDG-PET images indicated its possibility to predict local treatment outcomes in OPSCCs.},

  abstract = {This work presents improvements of a global optimization method for bound constraint problems along with theoretical results. These improvements are strongly biased towards local search. The global optimization method known as DIRECT was modified specifically for small-dimensional problems with few global minima. The motivation for our work comes from our theoretical results regarding the behavior of DIRECT. Specifically, we explain how DIRECT clusters its search near a global minimizer. An additional influence is our explanation of DIRECT's behavior for both constant and linear functions.  We further improved the effectiveness of both DIRECT, and our modification, by combining them with another global optimization method known as Implicit Filtering. In addition to these improvements the methods were also extended to handle problems where the objective function is defined solely on an unknown subset of the bounding box. We demonstrate the increased effectiveness and robustness of our modifications using optimization problems from the natural gas transmission industry, as well as commonly used test problems from the literature.},

  abstract = {Skin marker-based stereophotogrammetry is the most widely used technique for human motion analysis but its accuracy is mainly limited by soft tissue artifact (STA) which reflects the non-rigidity of human body segments during activities. To compensate for the effects of STA and improve the accuracy of motion analysis, it is critical to understand the behavior and characteristics of soft tissue movement. By using a non-invasive approach, this study investigated the soft tissue movement on the thigh and shank of twenty healthy subjects during level walking which is one of the most important human daily activities and the basic content of clinical gait analysis. With the measurement of inter-marker translations and rotations on each segment, a 4D picture (3D space and time) of soft tissue deformation on the thigh and shank during walking was quantified in terms of the positional and orientational change between different skin locations. Soft tissue deformation showed nonuniform distribution at different locations as well as along different directions. The range of inter-marker movement was found to be up to 19.1 mm/19.61 on the thigh and 9.3 mm/8.61 on the shank. Results in this study provide useful information for understanding soft tissue movement behavior and exploring better marker configurations. Inter-marker movement exhibited similar patterns across subjects. This finding suggests the possibility that STA has inter-subject similarity, which is contrary to the prevailing opinion. This new insight may lead to more effective STA compensation strategies for skin marker-based motion analysis.},

We examined 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had a rotating platform total knee arthroplasty (NexGen LPS mobile, Zimmer Inc. Warsaw, USA). Fluoroscopic data was collected during a step-up motion six months postoperatively. A 3D{\textendash}2D model fitting technique was used to reconstruct the in vivo 3D kinematics. The femoral component showed more axial rotation than the polyethylene mobile-bearing insert compared to the tibia during extension. In eight knees, the femoral component rotated internally with respect to the tibia during extension. In the other two knees the femoral component rotated externally with respect to the tibia. In all 10 patients, the femur showed more axial rotation than the mobile-bearing insert indicating the femoral component was sliding on the polyethylene of the rotating platform during the step-up motion. Possible explanations are a too limited conformity between femoral component and insert, the anterior located pivot location of the investigated rotating platform design, polyethylene on metal impingement and fibrous tissue formation between the mobile-bearing insert and the tibial plateau.},

Topological data analysis identifies the features as connected components and holes in the images and describes the extent to which they persist across the image. These features are encoded in persistence diagrams, summaries of which can be used to discrimate between diabetic and healthy patients.

Using a Finite Element solver, the stress distribution within the foot structure was obtained and regions of elevated stresses for six subphases of the stance (initial-contact, heel-strike, midstance, forefoot-contact, push-off, and toe-off) were located. For each of these subphases, the model was adapted according to the corresponding fluoroscopic data, skeletal dynamics, and active muscle force loading. Validation of the stress state was achieved by comparing model predictions of contact stress distribution with respective CPD measurements. The presently developed measurement and numerical analysis tools open new approaches for clinical applications, from simulation of the development mechanisms of common foot disorders to pre- and post-interventional evaluation of their treatment.

Some recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that ImageNettrained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation instead when trained on `StylizedImageNet', a stylized version of ImageNet. This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560 psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions, highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.},

Intraoperative electrical nerve stimulation at repair showed that the maximal supraspinatus tension (up to 200 N) strongly correlated with the anatomic cross-sectional muscle area and with muscle fatty infiltration (ranging from 12 N/cm 2  in Goutallier stage 3 to 42 N/cm 2  in Goutallier stage 0). Within 1 year after successful tendon repair (n = 8), fatty infiltration did not recover, and atrophy improved partially at best; however, if the repair failed (n = 5), atrophy and fatty infiltration progressed significantly. The ability of the rotator cuff muscles to develop tension not only correlates with their atrophy but also closely correlates with their degree of fatty infiltration. With current repair techniques, atrophy and fatty infiltration appear to be irreversible, despite successful tendon repair. Unexpectedly, not only weak but also very strong muscles are at risk for repair failure.},

A data driven method to learn a manifold from a collections of brain images is proposed. We hypothesize that the space spanned by a set of brain images can be captured, to some approximation, by a low-dimensional manifold, i.e. a parametrization of the set of images. The approach builds on recent advances in manifold learning that allow to uncover nonlinear trends in data. We combine this manifold learning with distance measures between images that capture shape, in order to learn the underlying structure of a database of brain images. The proposed method is generative. New images can be created from the manifold parametrization and existing images can be projected onto the manifold. By measuring projection distance of a held out set of brain images we evaluate the fit of the proposed manifold model to the data and we can compute statistical properties of the data using this manifold structure. We demonstrate this technology on a database of 436 MR brain images.},

  abstract = {Abstract   The Standardization and Terminology Committee (STC) of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) proposes a general reporting standard for joint kinematics based on the Joint Coordinate System (JCS), first proposed by Grood and Suntay for the knee joint in 1983 (J. Biomech. Eng. 105 (1983) 136). There is currently a lack of standard for reporting joint motion in the field of biomechanics for human movement, and the JCS as proposed by Grood and Suntay has the advantage of reporting joint motions in clinically relevant terms.  In this communication, the STC proposes definitions of JCS for the ankle, hip, and spine. Definitions for other joints (such as shoulder, elbow, hand and wrist, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and whole body) will be reported in later parts of the series. The STC is publishing these recommendations so as to encourage their use, to stimulate feedback and discussion, and to facilitate further revisions.  For each joint, a standard for the local axis system in each articulating bone is generated. These axes then standardize the JCS. Adopting these standards will lead to better communication among researchers and clinicians.},

  abstract = {Since 1990, the Standardization and Terminology Committee of the International Society of Biomechanics has been working towards a recommendation for standardization in the reporting of kinematic data. The paper, which is a result of those efforts (including broad input from members of the Society), is intended as a guide to the presentation of kinematic data in refereed publications and other materials. It is hoped that some uniformity in presentation will make publications easier to read and allow for the more straightforward comparison of data sets from different investigators. It is not intended to restrict individual investigators in the manner in which they collect or process their data. Rather, it could be viewed as a ``output filter'' applied to a variety of data formats to provide uniformity in the final product. The ISB is cognizant of the various attempts at standardization that are being pursued by other organizations-such as CAMARC in Europe, the Clinical Gait Laboratory Group in the U.S.A., and the efforts of individual professional groups such as the Scoliosis Research Society. Where possible, we have sought unanimity with these groups, but on issues where the members of our society expressed strong opinions, we have-at timesstated a contrary view. One example in point is the use of center of mass-based segmental reference frames. Since such reference frames are needed for conventional dynamic analysis, we make the recommendation that such frames should be routinely used. We anticipate that extension to the present document in the future will include recommendations for joint coordinate systems and the definition of anatomical landmarks for locating other segmental reference frames. The committee recognizes that standardization of the description of movement at individual joints is best left to those who are intimately involved in the study of those joints, and we have therefore appointed subcommittees for various joints to provide recommendations. Groups are currently active for the ankle, hand, shoulder, spine, temporomandibular joints, whole body and wrist; members with interests and explrtise in other joints are being actively sought. The initial recommendations of some of these groups have already been published in the ISB Newsletter, and once these recommendation have been discussed by the membership, a subsequent document on joint coordinate systems will be published. The present recommendations are presented as a framework on which future progress can be based. We are grateful to former members of the Standardization and Terminology Committee (notably Professors John Paul, David Winter, and Don Grieve) and to the many ISB members who have commented on earlier drafts of this recommendation. The present paper owes much to the work of Sommer (1991).},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) registration is an essential problem in many medical applications. This problem aims at finding the rigid transformation parameters to match the projected image of a 3D model to the real one to estimate the 3D pose of the anatomical model. This class of image registration is computationally intensive due to the large number of solution assessments necessary to search the complex solution space. Moreover, the convergence of the solution process is contingent on a manual initialization of the solution close to the optimal solution. In this paper, we address both of these challenges by introducing a registration method which is significantly faster and less sensitive to initialization than existing methods. The method explores the properties of image gradient probability density function for registration and uses a weighted histogram of image gradient directions (WHGD) as the image feature. This simplifies the computation by searching the parameter space (rotations and translations) sequentially rather than simultaneously. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method was able to achieve sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy with 5\% of the solution assessments needed by an established existing method. The accuracy was not sensitive to the initial solution as long as it was within 90{\textdegree} and 30mm of the true registration, which is a substantial improvement over the existing methods.},

The traditional method for the generation of DRRs, namely ray-casting, is a computationally intensive process and accounts for most of solution time in 3D/2D medical image registration frameworks, where a large number of DRRs is required. A few alternate methods for a faster DRR generation have been proposed, the most successful of which are based on the idea of pre-calculating the attenuation value of possible rays. Despite achieving good quality, these methods support a limited range of motion for the volume and entail long pre-calculation time. In this paper, we propose a new preprocessing procedure and data structure for the calculation of the ray attenuation values. This method supports all possible volume positions with practically small memory requirements in addition to reducing the complexity of the problem from O( n  3 ) to O( n  2 ). In our experiments, we generated DRRs of high quality in 63 milliseconds with a preprocessing time of 99.48 seconds and a memory size of 7.45 megabytes.},

  abstract = {Marker-based optical motion capture (mocap) is the "gold standard" method for acquiring accurate 3D human motion in computer vision, medicine, and graphics. The raw output of these systems are noisy and incomplete 3D points or short tracklets of points. To be useful, one must associate these points with corresponding markers on the captured subject; i.e. "labelling". Given these labels, one can then "solve" for the 3D skeleton or body surface mesh. Commercial auto-labeling tools require a specific calibration procedure at capture time, which is not possible for archival data. Here we train a novel neural network called SOMA, which takes raw mocap point clouds with varying numbers of points, labels them at scale without any calibration data, independent of the capture technology, and requiring only minimal human intervention. Our key insight is that, while labeling point clouds is highly ambiguous, the 3D body provides strong constraints on the solution that can be exploited by a learning-based method. To enable learning, we generate massive training sets of simulated noisy and ground truth mocap markers animated by 3D bodies from AMASS. SOMA exploits an architecture with stacked self-attention elements to learn the spatial structure of the 3D body and an optimal transport layer to constrain the assignment (labeling) problem while rejecting outliers. We extensively evaluate SOMA both quantitatively and qualitatively. SOMA is more accurate and robust than existing state of the art research methods and can be applied where commercial systems cannot. We automatically label over 8 hours of archival mocap data across 4 different datasets captured using various technologies and output SMPL-X body models.

  abstract = {While measuring knee motion in all six degrees of freedom is important for understanding and treating orthopaedic knee pathologies, traditional motion capture techniques lack the required accuracy. A variety of model-based biplane fluoroscopy techniques have been developed with sub-millimeter accuracy. However, no studies have statistically evaluated the consistency of the accuracy across motions of varying intensity or between degrees of freedom. Therefore, this study evaluated the bias and precision of a contour-based tracking technique by comparing it to a marker-based method (gold standard) during three movements with increasing intensity. Six cadaveric knees with implanted tantalum markers were used to simulate knee extension, walking and drop landings, while motion was recorded by a custom biplane fluoroscopy system. The 3D geometries of the bones were reconstructed from CT scans and anatomical coordinate systems were assigned. The position and orientation of the bone and marker models were determined for an average of 27 frames for each trial and knee joint kinematics were compared. The average bias and precision was 0.0170.651 for rotations and 0.0170.59 mm for joint translations. Rotational precision was affected by motion (p{$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.04) and depended on the axis of rotation (p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.02). However, the difference in average precision among motions or axes was small (r0.131) and not likely of consequence for kinematic measurements. No other differences were found. The contour-based technique demonstrated sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy, indicating it is a highly accurate tool for measuring complex three dimensional knee movements of any intensity.},

  abstract = {Background: The role of degenerative changes in rotator cuff musculature with respect to the functional outcomes of rotator cuff repair have only recently been recognized and are still not well understood. In addition, the reversibility of these changes with repair of the tendons is questionable. Hypothesis: Poorer preoperative muscle quality negatively affects outcome, and a successful outcome (in terms of a healed repair) might demonstrate improvements in fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Thirty-eight patients (mean age, 62 years) were prospectively evaluated with preoperative and 1-year postoperative clinical examination and appropriate magnetic resonance image sequencing to determine grades of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES), Constant, and pain scores were determined as well as strength measurements. The retear rate and progression of muscle degeneration were also evaluated. Independent predictors of outcome measurements and cuff integrity were determined. Results: The overall clinical outcome, including ASES, Constant, and pain scores, improved significantly (P {$<$} .0001). Strength in forward elevation improved significantly (P {$<$} .006), while external rotation strength did not. There was a strongly negative correlation between muscle quality and outcome results in most cases. When the results were adjusted for multivariate effect, muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus muscle were the only independent predictors of ASES and Constant scores (P {$<$} .03). Tear size and rotator cuff healing did not play an independent role. Tear size, however, was the only independent predictor of ultimate cuff integrity (P = .002). Both atrophy and fatty infiltration progressed significantly over the course of the study. In cases in which the tendon had re-torn, the progression was found to be more significant than when the repair proved successful (P {$<$} .003). Conclusion: Muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles, particularly of the infraspinatus, play a significant role in determining functional outcome after cuff repair. Tear size appears to have the most influential effect on repair integrity. A successful repair did not lead to improvement or reversal of muscle degeneration and a failed repair resulted in significantly more progression. In general, healed repairs demonstrated minimal progression. These findings suggest that repairs should be performed, if possible, before more significant deterioration in the cuff musculature in order to optimize outcomes, and that understanding the degree of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration before surgery can help guide patient expectations.},

Applications of such analysis include understanding developmental and anatomical aspects of disorders when comparing patients versus normal controls, studying morphological changes caused by aging, or even differences in normal anatomy, for example, differences between genders. Once a quantitative description of organ shape is extracted from input images, the problem of identifying differences between the two groups can be reduced to one of the classical questions in machine learning of constructing a classifier function for assigning new examples to one of the two groups while making as few misclassifications as possible. The resulting classifier must be interpreted in terms of shape differences between the two groups back in the image domain. We demonstrate a novel approach to such interpretation that allows us to argue about the identified shape differences in anatomically meaningful terms of organ deformation. Given a classifier function in the feature space, we derive a deformation that corresponds to the differences between the two classes while ignoring shape variability within each class. Based on this approach, we present a system for statistical shape analysis using distance transforms for shape representation and the support vector machines learning algorithm for the optimal classifier estimation and demonstrate it on artificially generated data sets, as well as real medical studies.},

  abstract = {Humans can naturally and effectively find salient regions in complex scenes. Motivated by this observation, attention mechanisms were introduced into computer vision with the aim of imitating this aspect of the human visual system. Such an attention mechanism can be regarded as a dynamic weight adjustment process based on features of the input image. Attention mechanisms have achieved great success in many visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, video understanding, image generation, 3D vision, multi-modal tasks and self-supervised learning. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various attention mechanisms in computer vision and categorize them according to approach, such as channel attention, spatial attention, temporal attention and branch attention; a related repository this https URL is dedicated to collecting related work. We also suggest future directions for attention mechanism research.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence models present a fresh approach to chemogenomics and de novo drug design, as they provide researchers with the ability to narrow down their search of the chemical space and focus on regions of interest. We present a method for molecular de novo design that utilizes generative recurrent neural networks (RNN) containing long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. This computational model captured the syntax of molecular representation in terms of SMILES strings with close to perfect accuracy. The learned pattern probabilities can be used for de novo SMILES generation. This molecular design concept eliminates the need for virtual compound library enumeration. By employing transfer learning, we fine-tuned the RNN{$\prime$}s predictions for specific molecular targets. This approach enables virtual compound design without requiring secondary or external activity prediction, which could introduce error or unwanted bias. The results obtained advocate this generative RNN-LSTM system for high-impact use cases, such as low-data drug discovery, fragment based molecular design, and hit-to-lead optimization for diverse drug targets.},

Outcomes scores were compared between ``balanced'' and ``unbalanced'' patients.

Out of all confounding variables, balanced joints were the most significant contributing factor to improved postoperative outcomes (P b 0.001).

  abstract = {Medical datasets and especially biobanks, often contain extensive tabular data with rich clinical information in addition to images. In practice, clinicians typically have less data, both in terms of diversity and scale, but still wish to deploy deep learning solutions. Combined with increasing medical dataset sizes and expensive annotation costs, the necessity for unsupervised methods that can pretrain multimodally and predict unimodally has risen. To address these needs, we propose the first self-supervised contrastive learning framework that takes advantage of images and tabular data to train unimodal encoders. Our solution combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning strategies, and is simple and effective. In our experiments, we demonstrate the strength of our framework by predicting risks of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (CAD) using cardiac MR images and 120 clinical features from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our approach to natural images using the DVM car advertisement dataset. We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and through attribution and ablation experiments find that morphometric tabular features, describing size and shape, have outsized importance during the contrastive learning process and improve the quality of the learned embeddings. Finally, we introduce a novel form of supervised contrastive learning, label as a feature (LaaF), by appending the ground truth label as a tabular feature during multimodal pretraining, outperforming all supervised contrastive baselines.11https://github.com/paulhager/MMCL-Tabular-Imaging},

Structure within time series data can be captured by the tools of topological data analysis (TDA). Persistent homology is the mostly commonly used data-analytic tool in TDA, and can effectively summarize complex high-dimensional data into an interpretable 2-dimensional representation called a \&lt;i\&gt;persistence diagram\&lt;/i\&gt;. Existing methods for statistical inference for persistent homology of data depend on an independence assumption being satisfied. While persistent homology can be computed for each time index in a time-series, time-series data often fail to satisfy the independence assumption. This paper develops a statistical test that obviates the independence assumption by implementing a multi-level block sampled Monte Carlo test with sets of persistence diagrams. Its efficacy for detecting task-dependent topological organization is then demonstrated on simulated fMRI data. This new statistical test is therefore suitable for analyzing persistent homology of fMRI data, and of non-independent data in general.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Much of the chemopreventive effects of green tea are attributed to its major polyphenolic constituent ({\dbend} ) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In the present study, we report that EGCGinduced apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells is mediated via modulation of two related pathways: (a) stabilization of p53 by phosphorylation on critical serine residues and p14 ARF -mediated downregulation of murine double minute 2(MDM2) protein, and (b) negative regulation of NF-jB activity, thereby decreasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2. EGCGinduced stabilization of p53 caused an upregulation in its transcriptional activity, thereby resulting in activation of its downstream targets p21/WAF1 and Bax. Thus, EGCG had a concurrent effect on two important transcription factors p53 and NF-jB, causing a change in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in a manner that favors apoptosis. This altered expression of Bcl-2 family members triggered the activation of initiator capsases 9 and 8 followed by activation of effector caspase 3. Activation of the caspases was followed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and induction of apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that EGCG induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells by shifting the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in favor of apoptosis.

  abstract = {Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation. The popular ``U-shaped'' network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such longrange information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021 segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing approaches in the validation phase.},

Such methods employ black-box search algorithms over image transformations with continuous or discrete parameters and require a long time to obtain better strategies. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy search pipeline for data augmentation, which is much faster than previous methods. We introduce approximate gradients for several transformation operations with discrete parameters as well as the differentiable mechanism for selecting operations. As the objective of training, we minimize the distance between the distributions of augmented data and the original data, which can be differentiated. We show that our method, Faster AutoAugment, achieves significantly faster searching than prior work without a performance drop.},

In this article, we review the techniques required to create and employ these 3D SSMs. While we concentrate on landmark-based shape representations and thoroughly examine the most popular variants of Active Shape and Active Appearance models, we also describe several alternative approaches to statistical shape modeling. Structured into the topics of shape representation, model construction, shape correspondence, local appearance models and search algorithms, we present an overview of the current state of the art in the field. We conclude with a survey of applications in the medical field and a discussion of future developments.},

A secondary purpose was to assess the relationship between IMAT and muscle strength, power, and physical function. Subjects and Methods: Six participants with obesity, DM, and PN (2 women, 4 men; mean age=58 years, SD=10; mean body mass index=36.3, SD=5; mean modified Physical Performance Test [PPT] score=22, SD=3) and 6 age- and sex-matched control subjects without these impairments were assessed and compared in muscle strength, muscle power, physical functioning, and muscle and fat volume, including IMAT in the calf muscles. Muscle, adipose tissue, and IMAT volumes of each calf were quantified by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging. Muscle strength and power of the plantar-flexor and dorsiflexor muscles were quantified using isokinetic dynamometry. The modified PPT was used to assess physical function. Results: Leg muscle and fat volumes were similar between groups, although IMAT volumes were 2.2-fold higher in the subjects with obesity, DM, and PN (X=120 cm3, SD=47) than in the control subjects (X=54 cm3, SD=41). Muscle strength, muscle power, ratio of leg muscle power to leg muscle volume, and modified PPT scores were lower in subjects with obesity, DM, and PN compared with the control subjects. Discussion and Conclusion: The data indicate that excess fat infiltration in leg skeletal muscles is associated with low calf muscle strength, low calf muscle power, and impaired physical function in individuals who are obese with DM and PN.},

In people with knee OA, significant strength deficits were evident for all hip muscle groups evaluated (P {$<$} 0.05).

The second is incorporating a 3D geometric articulation model into the algorithm to improve estimation accuracy substantially for the depth translation, and to introduce contact points' trajectories between the articular surfaces. The third is an algorithm to process estimation even when the silhouettes of two components overlap. To assess our algorithm's potential for clinical application, we carried out two experiments. First, we used a robot to position the prosthesis. Estimation accuracy was checked by comparing input data to the robot with the estimates from X-ray photographs. Incorporating our articulation model remarkably reduced the error in the depth translation. Next, we performed a clinical assessment by applying the algorithm and articulation model to fluoroscopy images of a patient who had recently had TKA.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Objective. A method has been developed to accurately measure three-dimensional (3-D) femoral-tibial contact positions of artificial knee implants in vivo from X-ray fluoroscopy images using interactive 3-D computer vision algorithms. Design. A computerized graphical (CAD) model of an implant component is displayed as an overlay on the original X-ray image. An image matching algorithm matches the silhouette of the implant component against a library of images, in order to estimate the position and orientation (pose) of the component. The operator further adjusts the pose of the graphical model to improve the accuracy of the match. Background. Previous methods for in vivo measurement of joint kinematics make only indirect measurements of joint kinematics, require invasive procedures such as markers or pins, or make simplifying assumptions about imaging geometry which can reduce the accuracy of the resulting measurements. Methods. Fluoroscopic videos are taken of implanted knees in subjects performing weight-bearing motion. Images from the videos are digitized and stored on a computer workstation. Using computerized model matching, the relative pose of the two knee implant components can be determined in each image. The resulting information can be used to determine where the two components are contacting, the area of the contact region, liftoff angle, and other kinematic data. Results. Accuracy tests done on simulated imagery and in vitro real imagery show that the pose estimation method is accurate to less than 0.5 mm of error (RMS) for translations parallel to the image plane. Orientation error is less than or equal to 0.35 {\textdegree} about any axis. Errors are larger for translations perpendicular to the image plane (up to 2.25 mm). In a clinical study, the method was used to measure in vivo contact points, and characterize the kinematic patterns of two different knee implant designs. Conclusions. The ability to accurately measure knee kinematics in vivo is critical for the understanding of the behavior of knee implant designs and the ultimate development of new, longer lasting implants.},

  abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) have the potential to greatly accelerate many applications, yet programming models remain too low level. Many language-based solutions to date have addressed this problem by creating embedded domain-specific languages that compile to CUDA or OpenCL. These targets are meant for human programmers and thus are less than ideal compilation targets. LLVM recently gained a compilation target for PTX, NVIDIA's low-level virtual instruction set for GPUs. This lower-level representation is more expressive than CUDA and OpenCL, making it easier to support advanced language features such as abstract data types or even certain closures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by extending the Rust programming language with support for GPU kernels. At the most basic level, our extensions provide functionality that is similar to that of CUDA. However, our approach seamlessly integrates with many of Rust's features, making it easy to build a library of ergonomic abstractions for data parallel computing. This approach provides the expressiveness of a high level GPU language like Copperhead or Accelerate, yet also provides the programmer the power needed to create new abstractions when those we have provided are insufficient.},

The current study aimed to investigate the effects of inclination angles on the intralimb (inter-joint) and inter-limb sharing of the body support during downhill walking for a better understanding of the associated control strategy. Fifteen young male adults (age: 32.6 75.2 years, height: 168.97 5.5 cm, mass: 68.4 78.7 kg) performed level and downhill walking while their kinematic and kinetic data were measured for calculating joint moments and total support moments of the lower limbs using inverse dynamics analysis. The peak total support moments of both the leading and trailing limbs increased with increasing inclination angles (po 0.05) with different sharing patterns among individual joints. Being the major contributor to the peak total support moment during early single-limb support, the contribution of the knee remained unaltered (p40.05), but the contributions of the hip increased with reduced contributions from the ankle (p o0.05). For the increased peak total support moment during late single-limb support, the intra-limb sharing changed from a major ankle contribution to a major knee contribution strategy. The hip contribution was also increased (p o0.05) but the hip flexor moment remained unaltered (p40.05). During double-limb support, the main contributor to the whole body support changed from the trailing limb to the leading limb with increasing inclination angles (po 0.05).},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate tibiofemoral joint contact paths during a functional activity (running) and investigate the relationship between these arthrokinematic measures and traditional kinematics (internal/external rotation). Methods Tibio-femoral motion was assessed for the contralateral (uninjured) knees of 29 ACL-reconstructed individuals during downhill running, using dynamic stereo X-ray combined with three-dimensional CT bone models to produce knee kinematics and dynamic joint contact paths. The joint contact sliding length was estimated by comparing femoral and tibial contact paths. The difference in sliding length between compartments was compared to knee rotation. Results Sliding length was significantly larger on the medial side (10.2 {$\pm$} 3.8 mm) than the lateral side (2.3 {$\pm$} 4.0 mm). The difference in sliding length between compartments (mean 7.8 {$\pm$} 3.0 mm) was significantly correlated with internal tibial rotation (P {\textbackslash} 0.01, R2 = 0.74). Conclusion The relationship between rotational knee kinematics and joint contact paths was specifically revealed as greater tibial internal rotation was associated with larger magnitude of sliding motion in the medial compartment.},

  abstract = {Comprehending knee motion is an essential requirement for studying the causes of knee disorders. In this paper, we propose a new 2-D{\textendash}3-D registration system based on jointconstraint model for reconstructing total knee motion. The proposed model that contains bone geometries and an articulated joint mechanism is first constructed from multipostural magnetic resonancevolumetric images. Then, the bone segments of the model are hierarchically registered to each frame of the given single-plane fluoroscopic video that records the knee activity. The bone posture is iteratively optimized using a modified chamfer matching algorithm to yield the simulated radiograph which is the best fit to the underlying fluoroscopic image. Unlike conventional registration methods computing posture parameters for each bone independently, the proposed femorotibial and patellofemoral joint models properly maintain the articulations between femur, tibia, and patella during the registration processes. As a result, we can obtain a sequence of registered knee postures showing smooth and reasonable physiologic patterns of motion. The proposed system also provides joint-space interpolation to densely generate intermediate postures for motion animation. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by computer simulation, animal cadaver, and in vivo knee testing. The mean target registration errors for femur, tibia, and patella were less than 1.5 mm. In particular, small out-of-plane registration errors [less than 1 mm (translation) and 2◦ (rotation)] were achieved in animal cadaver assessments.},

  abstract = {Objective We present a novel method for intraoperative image-based bone surface reconstruction and its validation. Materials and methods In the preoperative stage, we construct a CT-like intensity atlas of the anatomy of interest. In the intraoperative stage, we deformably register this atlas to fluoroscopic X-ray images of the patient anatomy. We iteratively refine the atlas-to-patient registration by establishing explicit correspondences between bone surfaces in the atlas and their projections in the X-ray images. The advantage of our method is its use of CT-quality intensity data for correspondence establishment, which eliminates the edgedetection problem and diminishes the miscorrespondence problem. We validate our method on two datasets: (1) an in vitro dry femur; (2) Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs, which were generated from 17 clinical CTs, and simulate realistic in vivo femurs. Results The mean surface approximation error of our femur atlas was 0.85 {$\pm$} 0.16 mm. On Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs, the mean surface reconstruction error was 1.40 {$\pm$} 0.55 mm. On a dry femur, the mean surface reconstruction error was 1.44 mm. Conclusion The results show that our reconstruction method is on par with the state of the art in reconstruction of ex vivo femurs. In addition, the results demonstrate that our method is effective in realistic simulations of the in vivo scenario.},

We focus primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. Then, we consider how to extend the techniques to rigid motion (translation and rotation). The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. Moreover, we show how the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image.},

Emphasis is placed on the case in which the model is allowed to translate and scale (independently in x and y) with respect to the image. This four-dimensional transformation space is searched rapidly while guaranteeing that no match will be missed.

These methods have the potential to be beneficial if used clinically, but current techniques are too slow or expensive to be clinically practical. One technical element of these methods for measuring natural bone motion is the use of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRRs can be very expensive to compute, or require expensive and fast computer hardware. In this technical development, a numerically efficient Siddon-Jacobs algorithm for computing DRRs was implemented on a consumer-grade graphics card using a programming language for parallel architectures. Compared to traditional voxel projec\- tion algorithms with a central-processing-unit-only implementation, the parallel computation implementation on the graphics card provided speedups of 650{\textendash}1546 times faster rendering, while retaining equivalent performance for joint kinematics measurements. The use of consumer grade graphics hardware may contribute to making model-image registration measurements of joint kinematics practical for clinical use.},

I believe that cancer will become curable using targeted and sustained chemotherapy by such nanoparticles at the earliest stage of disease.

The purpose of this study was to validate a technique for dynamically estimating the relative position and orientation of skeletal segments using RSA and single plane X-ray fluoroscopy. Two micrometer-based in vitro phantom models of the skeletal segments in the hip and knee joints were used. The spatial positions of tantalum markers that were implanted into each skeletal segment were reconstructed using RSA. The position and orientation of each segment were determined in fluoroscopy images by minimizing the difference between the markers measured and projected in the image plane. Accuracy was determined in terms of bias and precision by analyzing the deviation between the applied displacement protocol and measured pose estimates. Measured translational accuracy was less than 100 mm parallel to the image plane and less than 700 mm in the direction orthogonal to the image plane. The measured rotational error was less than 11. Measured translational and rotational bias was not statistically significant at the 95\% level of confidence. The technique allows real-time kinematic skeletal measurements to be performed on human subjects implanted with tantalum markers for quantitatively measuring the motion of normal joints and different implant designs.},

Materials and methods: Ten subjects who were judged clinically successful after a posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty were analyzed under dynamic conditions using fluoroscopy, following a quantitative evaluation of coronal and sagittal laxity using Telos and KT-2000 arthrometers under static conditions. Results: Under static conditions, the anteroposterior laxity averaged 10.3 mm at 30{\textdegree} of flexion, and 8.3 mm at 75{\textdegree}. Abduction and adduction at full extension averaged 3.7 and 4.4 mm, respectively. Under dynamic conditions, 7/10 subjects demonstrated posterior femoral rollback of their lateral condyle moving from full extension to maximum knee flexion, and 8/10 experienced normal axial rotation patterns during deep knee bend activity. Furthermore, 7/10 subjects exhibited screw-home motion. 4/10 subjects experienced greater than 1.0 mm of condylar liftoff. Conclusion: We could not predict a consistent relationship between the laxity and kinematics. The activity of the muscles and ligamentous tension under dynamic conditions might have a much greater effect on the kinematics with currently used prosthetic designs than the laxity of ligamentous structures under static conditions.},

The goal of this study was to identify the modes of shape variation of periarticular scapular anatomy in relation to the glenoid in nonpathologic shoulders. Computed tomography scans of 31 cadaveric scapulae, verified to be free of pathology, were three-dimensionally reconstructed. Statistical shape modeling and principal component analysis identified the modes of shape variation across the population. Corresponding linear and angular measurements quantified the morphometric variance identified by the modes. Linear measures were normalized to the radius of the inferior glenoid to account for differences in the scaling of the bones. Five modes captured 89.7\% of total shape variation of the glenoid and periarticular anatomy. Apart from size differences (mode 1: 33.0\%), acromial anatomy accounted for the largest variation (mode 2: 32.0\%). Further modes described variation in glenoid inclination (mode 3: 11.8\%), coracoid orientation and size (mode 4: 9.0\%), and variation in coracoacromial (CA) morphology (mode 5: 3.1\%). The average scapula had a mean acromial tilt of 49\,{$\pm$}\,7{\textdegree}, scapular spine angle of 61\,{$\pm$}\,6{\textdegree}, the glenoid inclination of 84\,{$\pm$}\,4{\textdegree}, coracoid deviation angle of 26\,{$\pm$}\,4{\textdegree}, coracoid length of 3.7\,{$\pm$}\,0.3 glenoid radii, and a CA base length of 5.6\,{$\pm$}\,0.5 radii. In this study, the identified shape modes explain almost all of the variance in scapular anatomy. The acromion exhibited the highest variance of all periarticular anatomic structures of the scapula in relation to the glenoid, which may play a role in many shoulder pathologies.},

  year = {In Review},
  abstract = {Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning enable autonomous measurement of total knee arthroplasty kinematics through single-plane fluoroscopy. However, symmetric implants present challenges in optimization routines, causing ``symmetry traps'' and ambiguous poses. Achieving clinically robust kinematics measurement requires addressing this issue. We devised an algorithm that converts a ``true'' pose to its corresponding ``symmetry trap'' orientation. From a dataset of nearly 13,000 human supervised kinematics, this algorithm constructs an augmented dataset of ``true'' and ``symmetry trap'' kinematics, used to train eight classification machine learning algorithms. The outputs from the highest-performing algorithm classify kinematics sequences as 'obviously true' or 'potentially ambiguous.' We construct a spline through 'obviously true' poses, and 'ambiguous' poses are compared to the spline to determine correct orientation. The machine learning algorithms achieved 88-94\% accuracy on our internal test set and 91-93\% on our external test set. Applying our spline algorithm to kinematics sequences yielded 91.1\% accuracy, 94\% specificity, but 67\% sensitivity. The accuracy of standard ML algorithms for implants within 5 degrees of a pure-lateral view was 71\%, rising to 88\% beyond 5 degrees. This pioneering study systematizes addressing model-image registration issues with symmetric tibial implants. High accuracy suggests potential use of ML algorithms to mitigate shape-ambiguity errors in pose measurements from single-plane fluoroscopy. Our results also suggest an imaging protocol for measuring kinematics that favors more oblique viewing angles, which could further disambiguate ``true'' and ``symmetry trap'' poses.},

Second, segmented images are compared to Normalized Fourier Descriptor shape libraries for initial pose estimates. Lastly, a Lipschitzian optimization routine minimizes the difference between the segmented image and the projected implant. This technique reliably reproduces human-supervised kinematics measurements from internal datasets and external validation studies, with RMS differences of less than 0.7mm and 4{\textdegree} for internal studies and 0.8mm and 1.7{\textdegree} for external validation studies. This performance indicates that it will soon be practical to perform these measurements in a clinical setting.},

However, current methods of measuring TKA kinematics are too cumbersome, inaccurate, or timeconsuming for practical clinical application. Even state-of-the-art techniques require human-supervision to obtain clinically reliable kinematics. Eliminating human supervision could potentially make this technology practical for clinical use. Methods: We demonstrate a fully autonomous pipeline for quantifying 3D-TKA kinematics from singleplane radiographic imaging. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) segmented the femoral and tibial implants from the image. Second, those segmented images were compared to precomputed shape libraries for initial pose estimates. Lastly, a numerical optimization routine aligned 3D implant contours and fluoroscopic images to obtain the final implant poses. Results: The autonomous technique reliably produces kinematic measurements comparable to humansupervised measures, with root-mean-squared differences of less than 0.7 mm and 4  for our test data, and 0.8 mm and 1.7  for external validation studies. Conclusion: A fully autonomous method to measure 3D-TKA kinematics from single-plane radiographic images produces results equivalent to a human-supervised method, and may soon make it practical to perform these measurements in a clinical setting.},

In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algo-rithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reli-able predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and dem-onstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles. All in all, we believe that the off-the-shelf descriptorbased models still can be directly employed to accurately predict various chemical endpoints with excellent comput-ability and interpretability.},

An integrated nomogram was constructed to demonstrate the added value of the imaging signature to established clinicopathologic factors for individualized survival prediction. Prediction performance was assessed with respect to discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.The DeLIS was associated with DFS and overall survival in the overall validation cohort and among subgroups defined by clinicopathologic variables, and remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis (P{$<$} 0.001). Integrating the imaging signature and clinicopathologic factors improved prediction performance, with C-indices: 0.792-0.802 versus 0.719-0.724, and net reclassification improvement 10.1\%-28.3\%. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved DFS in stage II patients with high-DeLIS [hazard ratio = 0.362 (95\% confidence interval 0.149-0.882)] and stage III patients with high- and intermediate-DeLIS [hazard ratio = 0.611 (0.442-0.843); 0.633 (0.433-0.925)]. On the other hand, adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect survival for patients with low-DeLIS, suggesting a predictive effect (Pinteraction = 0.048, 0.016 for DFS in stage II and III disease).The proposed imaging signature improved prognostic prediction and could help identify patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer.},

However, its application has remained challenging due to its low aqueous solubility, biochemical/structural degradation and poor bioavailability.

This review highlights the theoretical aspects and recent advances of preparation technologies (phase inversion temperature, phase inversion composition, ultrasonication, high pressure homogenization and microfluidization) for encapsulation of curcumin in nanoemulsions. Additionally, the specific factors in designing nanoemulsions systems that affect the chemical stability and in vitro bioaccessibility of the encapsulated curcumin are discussed. Also, the importance of nanoemulsions in improving antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of curcumin is underlined. Curcumin-loaded nanoemulsions preparation technologies have been proposed to provide efficient, systematic, and practical protocols for improved applications of curcumin. Additionally, key factors that influence curcumin delivery include the nature of emulsifier, the type and the amount of carrier oil and emulsifier-curcumin interactions. The pharmacological activities of curcumin including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities can be improved by nanoemulsions.},

Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for finding the global minimum of a multivariate function subject to simple bounds. The algorithm is a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function evaluations than most competing methods. The motivation for the new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants, and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast convergence of the new algorithm on the test functions.},

  abstract = {Objective  To assess the evidence of a relationship between muscle MRI and disease severity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  Methods  We conducted a systematic review of studies that analyzed correlations between MRI measurements and motor function in patients with DMD. PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using relevant keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria (January 1, 1990{\textendash}January 31, 2019). We evaluated article quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute scale. Information regarding the samples included, muscles evaluated, MRI protocols and motor function tests used was collected from each article. Correlations between MRI measurements and motor function were reported exhaustively.  Results  Seventeen of 1,629 studies identified were included. Most patients included were ambulant with a mean age of 8.9 years. Most studies evaluated lower limb muscles. Moderate to excellent correlations were found between MRI measurements and motor function. The strongest correlations were found for quantitative MRI measurements such as fat fraction or mean T2. Correlations were stronger for lower leg muscles such as soleus. One longitudinal study reported that changes in soleus mean T2 were highly correlated with changes in motor function.  Conclusion  The findings of this systematic review showed that MRI measurements can be used as biomarkers of disease severity in ambulant patients with DMD. Guidelines are proposed to help clinicians choose the most appropriate MRI measurements and muscles to evaluate. Studies exploring upper limb muscles, other stages of the disease, and sensitivity of measurements to change are needed.},

This study aimed to determine the association between vastus medialis volume, quality, and clinical outcomes after TKA. Methods: Among the patients who underwent unilateral TKA, 92 who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before TKA were included. Preoperative vastus medialis volume and quality were assessed using the cross-sectional area (CSA) and fat infiltration ratio on MRI. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Knee Society knee score (KSKS) and Knee Society function score (KSFS) at baseline and 1 year after surgery. The relationships between preoperative CSA, fatty infiltration ratio, and clinical outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariate linear regression. Results: Only the fatty infiltration ratio was significantly associated with postoperative KSFS in the univariate linear regression analysis. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, age and fatty infiltration ratio were significantly associated with postoperative KSFS. Conclusions: Increased vastus medialis fat infiltration is associated with worse functional outcomes after TKA. Preserving vastus medialis quality could improve functional outcomes, and surgeons should encourage patients to perform quadriceps strengthening exercises before surgery.},

  abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic pathology with chronic high blood glucose levels that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body does not properly use the insulin it produces. Diabetes management is a puzzle and focuses on a healthy lifestyle, physical exercise, and medication. Thus far, the condition remains incurable; management just helps to control it. Its medical treatment is expensive and is to be followed for the long term, which is why people, especially from low-income countries, resort to herbal medicines. However, many active compounds isolated from plants (phytocompounds) are poorly bioavailable due to their low solubility, low permeability, or rapid elimination. To overcome these impediments and to alleviate the cost burden on disadvantaged populations, plant nanomedicines are being studied. Nanoparticulate formulations containing antidiabetic plant extracts or phytocompounds have shown promising results. We herein aimed to provide an overview of the use of lipid- and inorganic-based nanoparticulate delivery systems with plant extracts or phytocompounds for the treatment of diabetes while highlighting their advantages and limitations for clinical application. The findings from the reviewed works showed that these nanoparticulate formulations resulted in high antidiabetic activity at low doses compared to the corresponding plant extracts or phytocompounds alone. Moreover, it was shown that nanoparticulate systems address the poor bioavailability of herbal medicines, but the lack of enough preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic trials still delays their use in diabetic patients.},

The window size must be large enough to include enough intensity variation for reliable matching, but small enough to avoid the effects of projective distortion. If the window is too small and does not cover enough intensity variation, it gives a poor disparity estimate, because the signal (intensity {\textbackslash} ariation) to noise ratio is low. If, on the other hand, the window i{\textbackslash} too large and covers a region in which the depth of scene points (i.e., disparity) varies, then the position of maximum correlation or minimum SSD may not represent correct matching due to different projective distortions in the left and right images. For this reason, a window size must be selected adaptively depending on local variations of intensity and disparity.},

In this study we compared 6 methods for calibrating a biplane fluoroscopy system including a new method using a novel nested-optimization technique. To quantify bias and precision, an electronic digital caliper instrumented with two tantalum markers on radiolucent posts was imaged in three configurations, and for each configuration placed in ten static poses distributed throughout the viewing volume. Bias and precision were calculated as the mean and standard deviation of the displacement of the markers measured between the three caliper configurations.},

The technique is based on minimization of the difference between the actually projected contour of an implant and the virtually projected contour of a model of that same implant. The advantage of model-based RSA over conventional marker-based RSA is that it is not necessary to attach markers to the implant. In this paper, three pose estimation algorithms for model-based RSA are evaluated. The algorithms were assessed on the basis of their sensitivities to noise in the actual contour, to the amount of drop-outs in the actual contour, to the number of points in the actual contour and to shrinkage or expansion of the actual contour. The algorithms that were studied are the iterative inverse perspective matching (IIPM ) algorithm, an algorithm based on minimization of the difference (DIF ) between the actual contour and the virtual contour, and an algorithm based on minimization of the non-overlapping area (NOA) between the actual and virtual contour. The results of the simulation and phantom experiments show that the NOA algorithm does not fulfil the high accuracy that is necessary for model-based RSA. The IIPM and DIF algorithms are robust to the different distortions, making model-based RSA a possible replacement for marker-based RSA.},

Failure risks delays in care, increased morbidity, and further financial burden. Deep learning permits automated image processing to mitigate the challenges behind expeditious, cost-effective preoperative planning. Our aim was to investigate whether a deeplearning algorithm could accurately identify the manufacturer and model of arthroplasty implants about the knee from plain radiographs. Methods: We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning algorithm to classify knee arthroplasty implants from one of 9 different implant models from retrospectively collected anteriorposterior (AP) plain radiographs from four sites in one quaternary referral health system. The performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when compared with a reference standard of implant model from operative reports. Results: The training and validation data sets were comprised of 682 radiographs across 424 patients and included a wide range of TKAs from the four leading implant manufacturers. After 1000 training epochs by the deep-learning algorithm, the model discriminated nine implant models with an AUC of 0.99, accuracy 99\%, sensitivity of 95\%, and specificity of 99\% in the external-testing data set of 74 radiographs. Conclusions: A deep learning algorithm using plain radiographs differentiated between 9 unique knee arthroplasty implants from four manufacturers with near-perfect accuracy. The iterative capability of the algorithm allows for scalable expansion of implant discriminations and represents an opportunity in delivering cost-effective care for revision arthroplasty.},

Drawing on the work of Jos e Esteban Mun{\textasciitilde}oz, the authors discuss five interrelated elements of DQSH that offer early childhood educators a way into a sense of queer imagination: play as praxis, aesthetic transformation, strategic defiance, destigmatization of shame, and embodied kinship. Ultimately, the authors propose that ``drag pedagogy'' provides a performative approach to queer pedagogy that is not simply about LGBT lives, but living queerly.},

Materials and Methods: The in vivo motion of the tibia relative to the femur was measured in subjects with posterior stabilized fixed-bearing (FB) and rotating-platform (RP) total knee arthroplasties using a high-speed stereo radiography system during a lunge and gait with a change in direction (pivot). Results: The in vivo internal/external (IE) rotation and anterior/posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur was similar between mobile and fixed-bearing total knee prostheses during two activities of daily living that included an activity that challenged tibial IE rotation. Measurements of IE rotation in participants with RP had higher variability and significantly greater range between maximum internal and external rotation compared with FB participants. The greater amount of variability of RP was not unlike the healthy knee. Conclusion: The pattern of IE rotation and AP translation for both RP and FB designs were similar to healthy kinematics but with less IE rotation. The RP implants more closely replicated the asymmetrical posterior condylar translation and range of IE rotation of the healthy knee during activity that challenged tibial IE rotation.},

It learns to localize using high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and unknown camera intrinsics, where point based SIFT registration fails. However, it was trained using a naive loss function, with hyper-parameters which require expensive tuning. In this paper, we give the problem a more fundamental theoretical treatment. We explore a number of novel loss functions for learning camera pose which are based on geometry and scene reprojection error. Additionally we show how to automatically learn an optimal weighting to simultaneously regress position and orientation. By leveraging geometry, we demonstrate that our technique significantly improves PoseNet's performance across datasets ranging from indoor rooms to a small city.},

They are the magnitudes of a set of orthogonal complex moments of the image known as Zernike moments. Scale and translation invariance are obtained by first normalizing the image with respect to these parameters using its regular geometrical moments. A systematic reconstruction-based method for deciding the highest-order Zernike moments required in a classification problem is developed. The quality of the reconstructed image is examined through its comparison to the original one. The orthogonality property of the Zernike moments, which simplifies the process of image reconstruction, make the suggest feature selection approach practical. Features of each order can also be weighted according to their contribution to the reconstruction process. The superiority of Zernike moment features over regular moments and moment invariants was experimentally verified. {$>$}},

Like in OA patients, gait patterns in rodent OA models shift to protect the injured limb during loading. However, unlike in OA patients, it is unknown how age affects gait changes in rodent OA models. In this study, gait compensations following meniscal injury in 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old rats were evaluated to examine age-effects of OA-related joint dysfunction. Rats 3, 6, and 9 months received medial collateral ligament transection plus medial meniscus transection (MCLT + MMT) surgery (n = 8/age group) or a skin incision (n = 8/age group). Postsurgery, rats underwent gait testing at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Postmortem, joints were processed for histology to assess cartilage damage. MCLT + MMT rats walked with reduced vertical loading in their injured limbs immediately after injury and throughout OA progression. Compared to sham-operated limbs, 6- and 9-month MCLT + MMT animals reduced loading in their injured limbs while 3-month MCLT + MMT animals did not. MCLT + MMT rats also increased stance time on the injured limb compared to the contralateral limb. Additionally, for the MCLT + MMT animals, 6- and 9-month animals had significantly worse cartilage damage compared to 3-month animals. These data indicated age at injury onset affects how animals load the OA-affected joint, with older animals developing gait compensations that more markedly reduce weight on the injured limb during walking.},

Background and objectivesWith significant increase in the number of people suffering from shoulder problems, the automatic image segmentation of the supraspinatus (one of the shoulder muscles) has become necessary for efficient and deliberate diagnosis and surgery. In this study, we developed an automatic segmentation method to extract the three-dimensional (3D) configuration of the supraspinatus, and we compared our segmentation results with reference segmentations obtained by experts. MethodsWe developed a two-stage active contour segmentation method using the level sets approach to automatically extract the supraspinatus configuration. In the first stage, a trial segmentation based on intensity and an internal shape fitting technique were performed. In the second stage, the undesired image portions of the trial segmentation were automatically identified by comparing the trial segmentation with the fitted shape, and then corrected by forcing the contour to stop evolution in the over-segmented region and pass through undesired edges in the under-segmented region. ResultsThe proposed method was found to provide highly accurate results when compared with the reference segmentations. This comparison was made on the basis of four measurements: accuracy (0.9950.001), Dice similarity coefficients (0.9510.011), average distance (0.4400.086mm), and maximal distance (3.0450.433mm). The proposed method could generate regular surfaces of the 3D supraspinatus. ConclusionsThe proposed automatic segmentation method provides a patient-specific tool to accurately extract the 3D configuration of the supraspinatus.},

There are several clinical indicators such as Goutallier grade and occupation ratio in the diagnosis and surgery of these diseases, but subjective intervention of the diagnosis is an obstacle in accurately detecting the correct region.    Methods  Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep learning algorithm to quantitatively detect the fossa and muscle region by measuring the occupation ratio of supraspinatus in the supraspinous fossa. In the development and performance evaluation of the algorithm, 240 patients MRI dataset with various disease severities were included.    Results  As a result, the pixel-wise accuracy of the developed algorithm is 0.9984{$\pm$}0.073 in the fossa region and 0.9988{$\pm$}0.065 in the muscle region. The dice coefficient is 0.9718{$\pm$}0.012 in the fossa region and 0.9463{$\pm$}0.047 in the muscle region.

In this paper, we show that the Zernike moment can be used as an effective descriptor of global shape of an image in a large image database.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Knee kinematics can be estimated by 2-D/3-D image registration from 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) models of knee implants to 2-D X-ray image. Although there are many studies for estimating knee kinematics, they have common problems that are dependency on initial pose/position and falling into local maxima. This study proposes a robust 2-D/3-D image registration method based on evolutional computing. The evolutional computing has both characteristics of global search performance and of local search performance. The characteristics are suitable for solving the problems of 2-D/3-D image registration. The proposed system has been evaluated by applying it to computer-synthesized images, X-ray images of phantoms, and X-ray images of TKA patients.},

  abstract = {In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appears to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a oneparameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusionequation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous stack of homogeneous layers, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem ("light and dark blobs") disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blob has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances.},

The two principal curvatures (taken as a pair) are more informative, but one would prefer a single shape indicator rather than a pair of numbers. Moreover, the shape indicator should preferably be independent of the size i.e. the amount of curvature, as distinct from the type of curvature. We propose two novel measures of local shape, the `curvedness' and the `shape index'. The curvedness is a positive number that specifies the amount of curvature, whereas the shape index is a number in the range (-1, + I] and is scale invariant. The shape index captures the intuitive notion of `local shape' particularly well. The shape index can be mapped upon an intuitively natural colour scale. Two complementary shapes (like stamp and mould) map to complementary hues. The symmetrical saddle (which is very special because it is self-complementary) maps to white. When a surface is tinted according to this colour scheme, this induces an immediate perceptual vegmentation of convex, concave, and hyperbolic areas. We propose it as a useful tool in graphics representation of 30 shape.},

  abstract = {Direct search methods are best known as unconstrained optimization techniques that do not explicitly use derivatives. Direct search methods were formally proposed and widely applied in the 1960s but fell out of favor with the mathematical optimization community by the early 1970s because they lacked coherent mathematical analysis. Nonetheless, users remained loyal to these methods, most of which were easy to program, some of which were reliable. In the past fifteen years, these methods have seen a revival due, in part, to the appearance of mathematical analysis, as well as to interest in parallel and distributed com puting. This review begins by briefly summarizing the history of direct search methods and considering the special properties of problems for which they are well suited. Our focus then turns to a broad class of methods for which we provide a unifying framework that lends itself to a variety of convergence results. The underlying principles allow general ization to handle bound constraints and linear constraints. We also discuss extensions to problems with nonlinear constraints.},

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of WB on in vivo kinematics of mobilebearing UKA during high knee flexion activities. Methods\hspace{0.6em} The kinematics of UKA were evaluated under fluoroscopy during squatting (WB) and active-assisted knee flexion (non-weight bearing, NWB). Range of motion, femoral axis rotation relative to the tibia, anteroposterior (AP) translation of the medial and lateral sides, and kinematic pathway were measured. Results\hspace{0.6em} There were no differences in knee flexion range and external rotation of the femur in each flexion angle between the WB conditions. The amount of femoral external rotation between minimum flexion and 60{\textdegree} of flexion during WB was significantly larger than that during NWB, and that between 60{\textdegree} and 130{\textdegree} of flexion during NWB was significantly larger than that during WB. There were no differences in medial AP translation of the femur in each flexion angle between the WB conditions. However, on the lateral side, posterior translation of 52.9\,{$\pm$}\,12.7\% was observed between minimum flexion and 130{\textdegree} of flexion during WB. During NWB, there was no significant translation between minimum flexion and 60{\textdegree} of flexion; beyond 60{\textdegree} of flexion, posterior translation was 41.6\,{$\pm$}\,8.7\%. Between 20{\textdegree} and 80{\textdegree} of flexion, the lateral side in WB was located more posteriorly than in NWB (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Mobile-bearing UKA has good anterior stability throughout the range of knee flexion. WB status affects the in vivo kinematics following mobile-bearing UKA.

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the dynamic knee motion in-vivo is instrumental for understanding normal and pathological function of the knee joint. However, interpreting motion of the knee joint during gait in other than the sagittal plane remains controversial. In this study, we utilized the dual fluoroscopic imaging technique to investigate the six-degree-of-freedom kinematics and condylar motion of the knee during the stance phase of treadmill gait in eight healthy volunteers at a speed of 0.67 m/s. We hypothesized that the 6DOF knee kinematics measured during gait will be different from those reported for non-weightbearing activities, especially with regards to the phenomenon of femoral rollback. In addition, we hypothesized that motion of the medial femoral condyle in the transverse plane is greater than that of the lateral femoral condyle during the stance phase of treadmill gait. The rotational motion and the anterior{\textendash}posterior translation of the femur with respect to the tibia showed a clear relationship with the flexion{\textendash}extension path of the knee during the stance phase. Additionally, we observed that the phenomenon of femoral rollback was reversed, with the femur noted to move posteriorly with extension and anteriorly with flexion. Furthermore, we noted that motion of the medial femoral condyle in the transverse plane was greater than that of the lateral femoral condyle during the stance phase of gait (17.472.0 mm vs. 7.476.1 mm, respectively; po0.01). The trend was opposite to what has been observed during non-weightbearing flexion or single-leg lunge in previous studies. These data provide baseline knowledge for the understanding of normal physiology and for the analysis of pathological function of the knee joint during walking. These findings further demonstrate that knee kinematics is activity-dependent and motion patterns of one activity (non-weightbearing flexion or lunge) cannot be generalized to interpret a different one (gait).},

This relationship is used for object recognition and positioning. Object models consist of collections of parametric surface patches and their intersection curves; this includes nearly all representations used in computer-aided geometric design and computer vision. The image contours considered are the projections of surface discontinuities and occluding contours. Elimination theory provides a method for constructing the implicit equation of these contours for an object observed under orthographic or perspective projection. This equation is parameterized by the object's position and orientation with respect to the observer. Determining these parameters is reduced to a fitting problem between the theoretical contour and the observed data points. The proposed approach readily extends to parameterized models. It has been implemented for a simple world composed of various surfaces of revolution and tested on several real images. {$>$}},

Ten patients with total knee replacements rose from a chair under simultaneous surveillance of a motion capture system, a force-plate and a fluoroscopy system. The ``true'' poses of the thigh and shank were defined by those of the femoral and tibial components obtained using a three-dimensional fluoroscopy method. The soft tissue artifacts of the skin markers were calculated as their movement relative to the underlying prosthesis components. The joint center translations, angles and moments at the knee were also calculated separately using skin markers and the registered prosthesis poses. Considerable soft tissue artifacts were found, leading to significantly underestimated flexion and internal rotation angles, and extensor moments, but overestimated joint center translations and adduction. The current study provides accurate data of the kinematics and kinetics of total knee replacements during sit-to-stand. The effects of soft tissue artifacts on the calculated joint center translations, angles and moments were also quantified for the first time in the literature.

Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1990 to 2003) was used in conjunction with United States Census Bureau data to quantify primary and revision arthroplasty rates as a function of age, gender, race and/or ethnicity, and census region. Projections were performed with use of Poisson regression on historical procedure rates in combination with population projections from 2005 to 2030. Results: By 2030, the demand for primary total hip arthroplasties is estimated to grow by 174\% to 572,000. The demand for primary total knee arthroplasties is projected to grow by 673\% to 3.48 million procedures. The demand for hip revision procedures is projected to double by the year 2026, while the demand for knee revisions is expected to double by 2015. Although hip revisions are currently more frequently performed than knee revisions, the demand for knee revisions is expected to surpass the demand for hip revisions after 2007. Overall, total hip and total knee revisions are projected to grow by 137\% and 601\%, respectively, between 2005 and 2030. Conclusions: These large projected increases in demand for total hip and knee arthroplasties provide a quantitative basis for future policy decisions related to the numbers of orthopaedic surgeons needed to perform these procedures and the deployment of appropriate resources to serve this need.},

  abstract = {Abstract   For  in vivo  impact loadings administered under controlled initial conditions, it was hypothesized that larger initial knee angles (IKA) and softer impacting interfaces would reduce impact loading and initial leg stiffness. A human pendulum was used to deliver controlled impacts to the right foot of 21 subjects for three IKA (0, 20 and 40{\textdegree}) and three interfaces (barefoot, soft and hard EVA foams). The external impact force and the shock experienced by the subjects' shank were measured simultaneously with a wall mounted force platform and a skin mounted accelerometer, respectively. Stiffness of the leg was derived using impact velocity and wall reaction force data. The results disproved the role of the knee joint in regulating initial leg stiffness and provided only partial support for the hypothesized improved cushioning. Larger knee flexion at contact reduced impact force but increased the shock travelling throughout the shank. Conversely, softer interfaces produced sizable reductions in both initial leg stiffness and severity of the impact experienced by the lower limb. Force rate of loading was found to be highly correlated ( r =0.95) to limb stiffness that was defined by the heel fat pad and interface deformations. These results would suggest that interface interventions are more likely to protect the locomotor system against impact loading than knee angle strategies.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to monitor selected aspects of the three-dimensional kinematics of the knee during walking with regular shoes and with modified shoes that induced either pronation or supination of the foot. Steinmann traction pins were inserted into the right tibia and femur of five adult men who had apparently normal lower extremities. Target clusters mounted onto the pins were filmed by four cine cameras operating at 100 frames/sec. Two trials per subject were analyzed for each of the three experimental conditions: regular running shoes, running shoes with a 10{\textdegree} valgus wedge, and running shoes with a 10{\textdegree} varus wedge. The different types of footwear induced only minor kinematic changes at the knee during the stance phase of walking. The angular patterns of the tibiofemoral joint were modified by less than 1{\textdegree}, whereas the translatory patterns were altered by 2 mm. Immediately following foot-strike, the valgus-wedge shoes caused the tibia to rotate internally 4{\textdegree} more than the varus-wedge shoes, but at the tibiofemoral joint no consistent differences in the pattern of internal-external rotation between normal and modified footwear were measurable. These findings suggest that, in the healthy lower extremity, increased internal and external tibial rotation is resolved at the hip joint, with changes at the tibiofemoral joint that barely are detectable with the techniques used in this study.},

Target markers were fixed to tibia and femur by means of intra-cortical traction pins. Radiographs of the lower limb were obtained to compute the position of the target markers relative to internal anatomical structures. High-speed cine cameras were used to measure three-dimensional coordinates of the target markers in five subjects walking at a speed of 1.2 m s-1. Relative motion between tibia and femur was resolved according to a joint coordinate system (JCS). The measurements have identified that substantial angular and linear motions occur about and along each of the JCS axes during walking. The results do not, however, support the traditional view that the so-called `screw home' mechanism of the knee joint operates during gait.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Rotator cuff (RC) tears are a common cause of upper extremity disability. Any tear size can result in subsequent muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration (FI). Preoperative muscle degeneration can predict repair and postoperative functional outcomes. Muscle residential fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are found to be capable of differentiating into beige adipocytes that release factors to promote muscle growth. This study evaluated the regenerative potential of local cell transplantation of beige FAPs to mitigate muscle degeneration in a murine massive RC tear model. Beige FAPs were isolated from muscle in UCP-1 reporter mice by flow cytometry as UCP-1               +               /Sca1               +               /PDGFR               +               /CD31               -               /CD45               -               /integrin {$\alpha$}7               -               . C57/BL6J mice undergoing supraspinatus tendon tear with suprascapular nerve transection (TT\,+\,DN) received either no additional treatment, phosphate-buffered saline injection, or beige FAP injection 2 weeks after the initial injury. Forelimb gait analysis was used to assess shoulder function with DigiGait. Mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after cell transplantation. FI, fibrosis, fiber size, vascularity were analyzed and quantified via ImageJ. Our results showed that beige FAP transplantation significantly decreased fibrosis, FI, and atrophy, enhanced vascularization compared with saline injection and non-treatment groups. Beige FAP transplantation also significantly improved shoulder function as measured by gait analysis. This study suggests that beige-differentiated FAPs may serve as a treatment option for RC muscle atrophy and FI, thus improving shoulder function in patients with massive RC tendon tears. {\textcopyright} 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

In this paper we propose a new shape description method that consists of a rotationally invariant angular radial transform descriptor (IARTD). The IARTD is a feature vector that combines the magnitude and aligned phases of the angular radial transform (ART) coefficients. A phase correction scheme is employed to produce the aligned phase so that the IARTD is invariant to rotation. The distance between two IARTDs is defined by combining differences in the magnitudes and aligned phases. In an experiment using the MPEG-7 shape dataset, the proposed method outperforms existing methods; the average BEP of the proposed method is 57.69\%, while the average BEPs of the invariant Zernike moments descriptor and the traditional ART are 41.64\% and 36.51\%, respectively.},

The principal risk factor for development of metabolic syndrome is obesity, defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on adipogenesis and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0{\textendash}50 {\textmu}M curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 {\textmu}M curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 {\textmu}M) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPAR{$\gamma$} and C/EBP{$\alpha$}, prevented differentiation medium-induced {$\beta$}-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that curcumin can induce preadipocyte apoptosis and inhibit adipocyte differentiation, leading to suppression of adipogenesis.},

This, in turn, requires optimization over the permutation group, made challenging by differences in nodes (in terms of numbers, locations) and edges (in terms of shapes, placements, and sizes) across objects. This paper tackles this registration problem using a novel neural-network architecture and involves an unsupervised loss function developed using the elastic shape metric for curves. This architecture results in (1) state-of-the-art matching performance and (2) an order of magnitude reduction in the computational cost relative to baseline approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both simulated data and real-world 2D and 3D shape graphs. Code and data will be made publicly available after review to foster research.},

Magnetic resonance images were acquired for both the intact and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees to construct computer knee models of the surfaces of the bone and cartilage. Each patient performed a singleleg weight-bearing lunge as images were recorded with use of a dual fluoroscopic system at full extension and at 15{\textdegree}, 30{\textdegree}, 60{\textdegree}, and 90{\textdegree} of flexion. The in vivo knee position at each flexion angle was then reproduced with use of the knee models and fluoroscopic images. The contact points were defined as the centroids of the areas of intersection of the tibial and femoral articular cartilage surfaces. Results: The contact points moved not only in the anteroposterior direction but also in the mediolateral direction in both the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient and intact knees. In the anteroposterior direction, the contact points in the medial compartment of the tibia were more posterior in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees than in the intact knees at full extension and 15{\textdegree} of flexion (p {$<$} 0.05). No significant differences were observed with regard to the anteroposterior motion of the contact points in the lateral compartment of the tibia. In the mediolateral direction, there was a significant lateral shift of the contact points in the medial compartment of the tibia toward the medial tibial spine between full extension and 60{\textdegree} of flexion (p {$<$} 0.05). The contact points in the lateral compartment of the tibia shifted laterally, away from the lateral tibial spine, at 15{\textdegree} and 30{\textdegree} of flexion (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: In the presence of anterior cruciate ligament injury, the contact points shift both posteriorly and laterally on the surface of the tibial plateau. In the medial compartment, the contact points shift toward the medial tibial spine, a region where degeneration is observed in patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament injuries.},

  abstract = {Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation is an important step in several medical imaging applications such as 2D{\textendash}3D image registration, where the generation of DRR is a rate-limiting step. We present a novel DRR generation technique, called the adaptive Monte Carlo volume rendering (AMCVR) algorithm. It is based on the conventional Monte Carlo volume rendering (MCVR) technique that is very efficient for rendering large medical datasets. In contrast to the MCVR, the AMCVR does not produce sample points by sampling directly in the entire volume domain. Instead, it adaptively divides the entire volume domain into sub-domains using importance separation and then performs sampling in these sub-domains. As a result, the AMCVR produces almost the same image quality as that obtained with the MCVR while only using half samples, and increases projection speed by a factor of 2. Moreover, the AMCVR is suitable for fast memory addressing, which further improves processing speed. Independent of the size of medical datasets, the AMCVR allows for achieving a frame rate of about 15 Hz on a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 PC while generating reasonably good quality DRR.},

The method used for obtaining the estimates of the Fourier descriptors minimizes a sum of two terms; the first term of which is a least square fit to the given data subject to the condition that the number of missing boundary points is not known and the second term is the perimeter2/area of the unknown shape. Experiments with synthetic and real boundaries show that estimates closer to the true values of Fourier descriptors of complete boundaries are obtained. Also, classification experiments performed using real boundaries indicate that reasonable classification accuracies are obtained even when 20-30 percent of the data is missing.},

The current study aimed to compare the STA and their effects on the kinematics of the knee between twelve patients with TKR and twelve healthy controls during sit-to-stand, and to assess the effects of STA on the statistical betweengroup comparisons. Each subject performed the sit-to-stand task while motions of the skin markers and the knees were measured by a motion capture system integrated with a three-dimensional fluoroscopy technique. The bone motions measured by the three-dimensional fluoroscopy were taken as the gold standard, with respect to which the STA of the markers were obtained. The STA were found to affect the calculated segmental poses and knee kinematics between the groups differently. The STA resulted in artefactual posterior displacements of the knee joint center, with magnitudes significantly greater in TKR than controls (p {$<$} 0.01). The STA-induced knee external rotations in TKR were smaller than those in controls with mean differences of 2.3{\textendash}3.08. These between-group differences in the STA effects on knee kinematics in turn concealed the true between-group differences in the anterior{\textendash}posterior translation and internal/external rotation of knee while leading to false significant between-group differences in the abduction/adduction and proximal{\textendash}distal translation.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the primary green tea catechin, could act directly on adipocytes to inhibit adipogenesis and induce apoptosis. Research Methods and Procedures: Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mature adipocytes were used. To test the effect of EGCG on viability, cells were incubated for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours with 0, 50, 100, or 200 {$\mu$}M EGCG. Viability was quantitated by MTS assay. To determine the effect of EGCG on apoptosis, adipocytes were incubated for 24 hours with 0 to 200 {$\mu$}M EGCG, then stained with annexin V and propidium iodide and analyzed by laser scanning cytometry. Both preadipocytes and adipocytes were also analyzed for apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay. To determine the effect of EGCG on adipogenesis, maturing preadipocytes were incubated during the 6-day induction period with 0 to 200 {$\mu$}M EGCG, then stained with Oil-Red-O and analyzed for lipid content. Results: EGCG had no effect on either viability or apoptosis of preconfluent preadipocytes. EGCG also did not affect viability of mature adipocytes; however, EGCG increased apoptosis in mature adipocytes, as demonstrated by both laser scanning cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays. Furthermore, EGCG dose-dependently inhibited lipid accumulation in maturing preadipocytes. Discussion: These results demonstrate that EGCG can act directly to inhibit differentiation of preadipocytes and to induce apoptosis of mature adipocytes and, thus, could be an important adjunct in the treatment of obesity.},

Then we present DIRECT-a, a modification of DIRECT, to eliminate the sensitivity to linear scaling of the objective function. We prove theoretically that linear scaling of the objective function does not affect the performance of DIRECT-a. Similarly, we prove that some modifications of DIRECT are also unaffected by linear scaling of the objective function, while the original DIRECT algorithm is sensitive to linear scaling. Numerical results in this paper show that DIRECT-a is more robust than the original DIRECT algorithm, which support the theoretical results. Numerical results also show that careful choices of the parameter e can help DIRECT perform well when the objective function is poorly linearly scaled.

We propose two strategies. The first one is based on the knowledge of the global optimum value of the objective function. In this case the selection strategy is able to guarantee convergence of every infinite sequence of trial points to global minimum points. The second one does not require any a priori knowledge on the objective function and tries to exploit information on the objective function gathered during progress of the algorithm.

The method is noninvasive, anatomybased, requires simple user interaction, and includes validation. It is generic and easily customizable for a variety of routine clinical uses in orthopaedic surgery. Gradient-based registration consists of three steps: 1) initial pose estimation; 2) coarse geometry-based registration on bone contours, and; 3) fine gradient projection registration (GPR) on edge pixels. It optimizes speed, accuracy, and robustness. Its novelty resides in using volume gradients to eliminate outliers and foreign objects in the fluoroscopic X-ray images, in speeding up computation, and in achieving higher accuracy. It overcomes the drawbacks of intensity-based methods, which are slow and have a limited convergence range, and of geometry-based methods, which depend on the image segmentation quality. Our simulated, in vitro, and cadaver experiments on a human pelvis CT, dry vertebra, dry femur, fresh lamb hip, and human pelvis under realistic conditions show a mean 0.5{\textendash}1.7 mm (0.5{\textendash}2.6 mm maximum) target registration accuracy.},

Research in shape analysis has been motivated, in part, by studies of human visual form perception systems. Several theories of visual form perception are briefly mentioned. Shape analysis methods are classified into several groups. Classification is determined according to the use of shape boundary or interior, and according to the type of result. An overview of the most representative methods is presented.},

  abstract = {Summary   Background  Radiotherapy continues to be delivered without consideration of individual tumour characteristics. To advance towards more precise treatments in radiotherapy, we queried the lung CT-derived feature space to identify radiation sensitivity parameters that can predict treatment failure and hence guide the individualisation of radiotherapy dose.    Methods  An institutional review board-approved study (IRB 14-562) was used to identify patients treated with lung stereotactic body radiotherapy. Patients with primary (stage IA{\textendash}IV) or recurrent lung cancer and patients with other cancer types with solitary metastases or oligometastases to the lung were included. Patients without digitally accessible CT image or radiotherapy structure data were excluded. The internal study cohort received treatment at the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH, USA). The independent validation cohort received treatment at seven affiliate regional or national sites. We input pre-therapy lung CT images into Deep Profiler, a multi-task deep neural network that has radiomics incorporated into the training process, to generate an image fingerprint that predicts time-to-event treatment outcomes and approximates classical radiomic features. We validated our findings with the independent study cohort. Deep Profiler was combined with clinical variables to derive iGray, an individualised dose that estimates treatment failure probability to be below 5\%.    Findings  A total of 1275 patients were assessed for eligibility and 944 met our eligibility criteria; 849 were in the internal study cohort and 95 were in the independent validation cohort. Radiation treatments in patients with high Deep Profiler scores failed at a significantly higher rate than in patients with low scores; 3-year cumulative incidence of local failure in the internal study cohort was 20{$\cdot$}3\% (16{$\cdot$}0{\textendash}24{$\cdot$}9) in patients with high Deep Profiler scores and 5{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}5{\textendash}8{$\cdot$}8) in patients with low Deep Profiler scores (hazard ratio [HR]=3{$\cdot$}64 [95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}19{\textendash}6{$\cdot$}05], p    Interpretation  Our results indicate that there are image-distinct subpopulations that have differential sensitivity to radiotherapy. The image-based deep learning framework proposed herein is the first opportunity to use medical images to individualise radiotherapy dose. Our results signify a new roadmap for deep learning-guided predictions and treatment guidance in the image-replete and highly standardised discipline of radiation oncology.

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution.

We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

Of these patients, 64 completed a minimum one year follow-u\- p. Patients completed full-f\-lexion kneeling while being imaged using single-\-plane fluoroscopy. Kinematics were calculated by registering the 3D implant models onto 2D-d\- ynamic fluoroscopic images and exported for analysis. Results CR-\-FB designs had significantly lower maximal flexion (mean 116{\textdegree} (SD 2.1{\textdegree})) compared to CR-\-RP (123{\textdegree} (SD 1.6{\textdegree})) and PS-F\- B (125{\textdegree} (SD 2.1{\textdegree})). The PS-F\- B design displayed a more posteriorly positioned femur throughout flexion. Furthermore, the CR-R\- P femur was more externally rotated throughout kneeling. Finally, individual patient kinematics showed high degrees of variability within all designs. Conclusion The increased maximal flexion found in the PS-F\- B and CR-R\- P designs were likely achieved in different ways. The PS-F\- B design uses a cam-p\- ost to hold the femur more posteriorly preventing posterior impingement. The external rotation within the CR-R\- P design was surprising and hasn't previously been reported. It is likely due to the polyethylene bearing being decoupled from flexion. The findings of this study provide insights into the function of different knee arthroplasty designs in the context during deep kneeling and provide clinicians with a more kinematically informed choice for implant selection and may allow improved management of patients' functional expectations.},

  abstract = {Background: Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a prevalent condition in young people. While it is widely believed that abnormal patellar tracking plays a role in the development of patellofemoral pain syndrome, this link has not been established. The purpose of this cross-sectional case-control study was to test the hypothesis that patterns of patellar spin, tilt, and lateral translation make it possible to distinguish individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome and clinical evidence of patellar malalignment from those with patellofemoral pain syndrome and no clinical evidence of malalignment and from individuals with no knee problems. Methods: Three-dimensional patellofemoral joint kinematics in one knee of each of sixty volunteers (twenty in each group described above) were assessed with use of a new, validated magnetic resonance imaging-based method. Static low-resolution scans of the loaded knee were acquired at five different angles of knee flexion (ranging between -4{\textdegree} and 60{\textdegree}). High-resolution geometric models of the patella, femur, and tibia and associated coordinate axes were registered to the bone positions on the low-resolution scans to determine the patellar motion as a function of knee flexion angle. Hierarchical modeling was used to identify group differences in patterns of patellar spin, tilt, and lateral translation. Results: No differences in the overall pattern of patellar motion were observed among groups (p {$>$} 0.08 for all global maximum likelihood ratio tests). Features of patellar spin and tilt patterns varied greatly between subjects across all three groups, and no significant group differences were detected. At 19{\textdegree} of knee flexion, the patellae in the group with patellofemoral pain and clinical evidence of malalignment were positioned an average of 2.25 mm more laterally than the patellae in the control group, and this difference was marginally significant (p = 0.049). Other features of the pattern of lateral translation did not differ, and large overlaps in values were observed across all groups. Conclusions: It cannot be determined from our cross-sectional study whether the more lateral position of the patella in the group with clinical evidence of malalignment preceded or followed the onset of symptoms. It is clear from the data that an individual with patellofemoral pain syndrome cannot be distinguished from a control subject by examining patterns of spin, tilt, or lateral translation of the patella, even when clinical evidence of mechanical abnormality was observed.},

If the geometry of the object is known, as well as the details of the image formation process, then the pose of the object with respect to the sensor can be determined.

  abstract = {A method was developed for registering three-dimensional knee implant models to single plane X-ray fluoroscopy images. We use a direct image-to-image similarity measure, taking advantage of the speed of modern computer graphics workstations to quickly render simulated (predicted) images. As a result, the method does not require an accurate segmentation of the implant silhouette in the image (which can be prone to errors). A robust optimization algorithm (simulated annealing) is used that can escape local minima and find the global minimum (true solution). Although we focus on the analysis of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in this paper, the method can be (and has been) applied to other implanted joints, including, but not limited to, hips, ankles, and temporomandibular joints. Convergence tests on an in vivo image show that the registration method can reliably find poses that are very close to the optimal (i.e., within 0.4 and 0.1 mm), even from starting poses with large initial errors. However, the precision of translation measurement in the (out-of-plane) direction is not as good. We also show that the method is robust with respect to image noise and occlusions. However, a small amount of user supervision and intervention is necessary to detect cases when the optimization algorithm falls into a local minimum. Intervention is required less than 5\% of the time when the initial starting pose is reasonably close to the correct answer, but up to 50\% of the time when the initial starting pose is far away. Finally, extensive evaluations were performed on cadaver images to determine accuracy of relative pose measurement. Comparing against data derived from an optical sensor as a ``gold standard,'' the overall rootmean-square error of the registration method was approximately 1.5 and 0.65 mm (although translation error was higher). However, uncertainty in the optical sensor data may account for a large part of the observed error.},

We additionally evaluated the applicability of microscopic image cytometry as a tool for measuring intracellular MTT reduction at the single-cell level. Our findings show that the assay measurements are a result of a complicated process dependant on many of the above-mentioned factors, and therefore, optimization of the assay and rational interpretation of the data is necessary to prevent misleading conclusions on variables such as cell viability, treatment toxicity, and/or cell metabolism.

  abstract = {Background: Recent findings suggest that higher levels of intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) are associated with glucose dysregulation, lower levels of muscle strength, and a heightened risk of disability. Although several studies have described adaptations in muscle after reduced physical activity, the change in IMAT in healthy young adults is unknown. Objective: The objective was to determine whether reduced lower limb activity alters IMAT in healthy young adults and to assess whether this change affects muscle strength loss. Design: The subjects (6 men and 12 women aged 19-28 y) underwent a 4-wk control period, which was followed by 4 wk of unilateral lower limb suspension. Volumes of whole muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and IMAT were assessed by using magnetic resonance imaging in the thigh and calf. Muscle strength was assessed during maximal voluntary isometric contractions. Results: No changes were observed in the control period. Reduced physical activity decreased thigh and calf muscle volumes by 7.4\% and 7.9\% (P {$<$} 0.001), respectively; no significant change in subcutaneous adipose tissue was observed. Additionally, IMAT increased in both regions; the increase was larger in the calf (20\%) than in the thigh (14.5\%) (P {$\leq$} 0.005) and was partially explained by the loss in muscle (R 2  = 26\%). The loss in strength was greater in the thigh (20.4\%) than in the calf (15\%). Strength loss was associated with increases in IMAT (P = 0.039) after adjustment for the loss in muscle, initial strength, initial IMAT, and initial muscle volume. Conclusions: IMAT accumulates markedly after reduced activity in healthy young adults. Increases in IMAT may contribute to losses in muscle strength associated with reduced physical activity, but the mechanism responsible is yet to be determined.},

  abstract = {Background: Descriptive epidemiology of total joint replacement procedures is limited to annual procedure volumes (incidence). The prevalence of the growing number of individuals living with a total hip or total knee replacement is currently unknown. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of total hip and total knee replacement in the United States. Methods: Prevalence was estimated using the counting method by combining historical incidence data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases from 1969 to 2010 with general population census and mortality counts. We accounted for relative differences in mortality rates between those who have had total hip or knee replacement and the general population. Results: The 2010 prevalence of total hip and total knee replacement in the total U.S. population was 0.83\% and 1.52\%, respectively. Prevalence was higher among women than among men and increased with age, reaching 5.26\% for total hip replacement and 10.38\% for total knee replacement at eighty years. These estimates corresponded to 2.5 million individuals (1.4 million women and 1.1 million men) with total hip replacement and 4.7 million individuals (3.0 million women and 1.7 million men) with total knee replacement in 2010. Secular trends indicated a substantial rise in prevalence over time and a shift to younger ages. Conclusions: Around 7 million Americans are living with a hip or knee replacement, and consequently, in most cases, are mobile, despite advanced arthritis. These numbers underscore the substantial public health impact of total hip and knee arthroplasties.},

The tests require novel statistical and geometrical analyses of the Procrustes shape manifold. For describing components of symmetry and asymmetry within samples, an extension of principal component analysis is introduced and illustrated by appropriate deformation techniques.

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\$-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum's area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process.},

  abstract = {An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define 'placetokens' in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that 'non-attentive' vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down.},

  journal = {Proceedings of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences},
  doi = {10.1098/rspb.1980.0020},
  abstract = {A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of ∇ 2  G(x, y) *  I(x, y)  for image I, where  G(x, y)  is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and ∇ 2  is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround ∇ 2  G  filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr \& Ullman 1979).},

  abstract = {Matching deformable objects using their shapes is an important problem in computer vision since shape is perhaps the most distinguishable characteristic of an object. The problem is difficult due to many factors such as intra-class variations, local deformations, articulations, viewpoint changes and missed and extraneous contour portions due to errors in shape extraction. While small local deformations has been handled in the literature by allowing some leeway in the matching of individual contour points via methods such as Chamfer distance and Hausdorff distance, handling more severe deformations and articulations has been done by applying local geometric corrections such as similarity or affine. However, determining which portions of the shape should be used for the geometric corrections is very hard, although some methods have been tried. In this paper, we address this problem by an efficient search for the group of contour segments to be clustered together for a geometric correction using Dynamic Programming by essentially searching for the segmentations of two shapes that lead to the best matching between them. At the same time, we allow portions of the contours to remain unmatched to handle missing and extraneous contour portions. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms other algorithms, especially when the shapes to be matched are more complex.},

  abstract = {Segmentation of bony structures in CT scans is a crucial step in knee arthroplasty based on personalized surgical instruments (PSI). As a matter of fact, the success of the surgery depends on the quality of the matching between the patient-specific resection jigs, manufactured exploiting the patient bony surfaces attained by segmentation, and true patient surfaces. Severe pathological conditions as chronic osteoarthritis, deteriorating the cartilages, narrowing the intra-articular spaces and leading to bone impingement, complicate the segmentation making the recognition of bony boundaries sub-optimal for traditional semi-automated methods and often extremely difficult even for expert radiologists. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been investigated in the last years towards automatic labeling of diagnostic images, especially harnessing the encoding-decoding U-Net architecture. In this article, we implemented deep CNNs to encompass the concurrent segmentation of the distal femur and the proximal tibia in CT images and evaluate how segmentation uncertainty may impact on the surgical planning. A retrospective set of 200 knee CT scans of patients was used to train the network and test the segmentation performances. Tests on a subset of 20 scans provided median dice, sensitivity and positive predictive value indices greater than 96\% for both shapes, with median 3D reconstruction error in the range of 0.5mm. Median 3D errors on both PSI femoral and tibial contact areas and surgical cut alignments were less than 2mm and 2◦, respectively, which can be considered clinically acceptable. These results substantiate that deep CNN architectures can disclose the opportunity of segmenting bone shapes in CT scans for PSI-based surgical planning with promising accuracy. However, we observed that segmentation scores alone cannot be taken as representative of the 3D errors at the contact areas of the PSI. Therefore when comparing segmentation algorithms of PSI-based surgical planning the 3D errors should be explicitly analyzed.},

Accurate prediction of Progression Free Survival (PFS) before treatment could make identification of high-risk patients before treatment feasible which makes it possible to intensify or de-intensify treatments for high- or low-risk patients. In this work, we proposed a deep learning based pipeline for PFS prediction. The proposed pipeline consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize the pyramid autoencoder for image feature extraction from both CT and PET scans. Secondly, the feed forward feature selection method is used to remove the redundant features from the extracted image features as well as clinical features. Finally, we feed all selected features to a DeepSurv model for survival analysis that outputs the risk score on PFS on individual patients. The whole pipeline was trained on 224 OPSCC patients. We have achieved a average C-index of 0.7806 and 0.7967 on the independent validation set for task 2 and task 3. The C-indices achieved on the test set are 0.6445 and 0.6373, respectively. It is demonstrated that our proposed approach has the potential for PFS prediction and possibly for other survival endpoints.},

IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 14, 239{\textendash}256.] for calculating the transformation parameters for a rigid body undergoing planar motion parallel to the image plane. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by estimating the finite centre of rotation and angle of rotation from lateral flexion/extension radiographs of the lumbar spine. In an in vitro error study, the method displayed an average error of rotation of 0:44 {\AE} 0:45 , and an average error in FCR calculation of 7:6 {\AE} 8:5 mm. The method was shown to be superior to that of Crisco et al. [Two-dimensional rigid-body kinematics using image contour registration.

Clinical Biomechanics Supplement 1, S5{\textendash}S83.] for the tests performed here. In general, we believe the use of splines to represent planar shapes to be superior to using digitised curves or landmarks for several reasons. First, with appropriate software, splines require less effort to define and are a compact representation, with most vertebra outlines using less than 30 control points. Second, splines are inherently sub-pixel representations of curves, even if the control points are limited to pixel resolutions. Third, there is a well-defined method (the ICP algorithm) for registering shapes represented as splines. Finally, like digitised curves, splines are able to represent a large class of shapes with little effort, but reduce potential segmentation errors from two dimensions (parallel and perpendicular to the image gradient) to just one (parallel to the image gradient). We have developed an application for performing all the necessary computations which can be downloaded from http://www.claritysmart.com.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previous research has quantified cervical spine motion with conventional measurement techniques (eg, cadaveric studies, motion capture systems, and fluoroscopy), but these techniques were not designed to accurately measure three-dimensional (3D) dynamic cervical spine motion under in vivo conditions. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to characterize the accuracy of model-based tracking for measuring 3D dynamic cervical spine kinematics and to demonstrate its in vivo application. STUDY DESIGN: Through accuracy assessment and application of technique, in vivo cervical spine motion was measured. METHODS: The accuracy of model-based tracking for measuring cervical spine motion was determined in an in vitro experiment. Tantalum beads were implanted into the vertebrae of an ovine specimen, and biplane X-ray images were acquired as the specimen's neck was manually moved through neck extension and axial neck rotation. The 3D position and orientation of each cervical vertebra were determined from the biplane X-ray images using model-based tracking. For comparison, the position and orientation of each vertebra were also determined by tracking the position of the implanted beads with dynamic radiostereometric analysis. To demonstrate in vivo application of this technique, biplane X-ray images were acquired as a human subject performed two motion tasks: neck extension and axial neck rotation. The positions and orientations of each cervical vertebra were determined with model-based tracking. Cervical spine motion was reported with standard kinematic descriptions of translation and rotation. RESULTS: The in vitro validation demonstrated that model-based tracking is accurate to within 60.6 mm and 60.6  for measuring cervical spine motion. For the in vivo application, there were significant rotations about all three anatomical axes for both the neck extension and axial neck rotation motion tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Model-based tracking is an accurate technique for measuring in vivo, 3D, dynamic cervical spine motion. Preliminary data acquired using this technique are in agreement with previous studies. It is anticipated that this experimental approach will enhance our understanding of cervical spine motion under normal and pathologic conditions. {\'O} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) method capable of (1) selecting a specific shoulder sagittal MR image (Y-view) and (2) automatically segmenting rotator cuff (RC) muscles on a Y-view. We hypothesized a CNN approach can accurately perform both tasks compared with manual reference standards. MATERIAL AND METHODS We created 2 models: model A for Y-view selection and model B for muscle segmentation. For model A, we manually selected shoulder sagittal T1 Y-views from 258 cases as ground truth to train a classification CNN (Keras/Tensorflow, Inception v3, 16 batch, 100 epochs, dropout 0.2, learning rate 0.001, RMSprop). A top-3 success rate evaluated model A on 100 internal and 50 external test cases. For model B, we manually segmented subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus/teres minor on 1048 sagittal T1 Y-views. After histogram equalization and data augmentation, the model was trained from scratch (U-Net, 8 batch, 50 epochs, dropout 0.25, learning rate 0.0001, softmax). Dice (F1) score determined segmentation accuracy on 105 internal and 50 external test images. RESULTS Model A showed top-3 accuracy {$>$} 98\% to select an appropriate Y-view. Model B produced accurate RC muscle segmentations with mean Dice scores {$>$} 0.93. Individual muscle Dice scores on internal/external datasets were as follows: subscapularis 0.96/0.93, supraspinatus 0.97/0.96, and infraspinatus/teres minor 0.97/0.95. CONCLUSIONS Our results show overall accurate Y-view selection and automated RC muscle segmentation using a combination of deep CNN algorithms.},

The study purpose was to determine if patient outcomes are affected by intraoperative ligament balance measured with force-sensing implant trials and if an optimal ``target'' balance exists. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective study reviewed consecutive TKAs performed by 3 surgeons. TKA's were performed with standard surgical techniques and ligament releases. After final implants were made, sensor-embedded smart tibial trials were inserted, and compartment forces recorded throughout the range of motion. Clinical outcome measures were obtained preoperatively and at 4 months. Statistical analysis correlated ligament balance with clinical outcomes. Results: One hundred eighty-nine consecutive TKAs were analyzed. Patients were grouped by average medial and lateral compartment force differences. Twenty-nine TKAs (15\%) were balanced within 15 lbs and 53 (28\%) were ``balanced'' greater than 75 lbs. Greater improvement in University of California Los Angeles activity level was associated with a mediolateral force difference {$<$}60 lbs. (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .006). Knee Society objective, function, and satisfaction scores, and self-reported health state were unrelated to mediolateral balance in the knee. Conclusion: Intraoperative force-sensing has potential in providing real-time objective data to optimize TKA outcomes. These data support some early outcomes may improve by balancing TKAs within 60 lbs difference. Close follow-up is warranted to determine if gait pattern adaptations affect longer term outcomes with greater or less ligament ``imbalance.''},

  journal = {VO LU M E},
  abstract = {Background: While total knee arthroplasty reduces pain and provides a functional range of motion of the knee, quadriceps weakness and reduced functional capacity typically are still present one year after surgery. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the role of failure of voluntary muscle activation and muscle atrophy in the early loss of quadriceps strength after surgery. Methods: Twenty patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis were tested an average of ten days before and twentyseven days after primary total knee arthroplasty. Quadriceps strength and voluntary muscle activation were measured with use of a burst-superimposition technique in which a supramaximal burst of electrical stimulation is superimposed on a maximum voluntary isometric contraction. Maximal quadriceps cross-sectional area was assessed with use of magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Postoperatively, quadriceps strength was decreased by 62\%, voluntary activation was decreased by 17\%, and maximal cross-sectional area was decreased by 10\% in comparison with the preoperative values; these differences were significant (p {$<$} 0.01). Collectively, failure of voluntary muscle activation and atrophy explained 85\% of the loss of quadriceps strength (p {$<$} 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that failure of voluntary activation contributed nearly twice as much as atrophy did to the loss of quadriceps strength. The severity of knee pain with muscle contraction did not change significantly compared with the preoperative level (p = 0.31). Changes in knee pain during strength-testing did not account for a significant amount of the change in voluntary activation (p = 0.14). Conclusions: Patients who are managed with total knee arthroplasty have profound impairment of quadriceps strength one month after surgery. This impairment is predominantly due to failure of voluntary muscle activation, and it is also influenced, to a lesser degree, by muscle atrophy. Knee pain with muscle contraction played a surprisingly small role in the reduction of muscle activation.},

We hypothesized that quadriceps strength would be more strongly correlated with functional performance than knee flexion range of motion (ROM) or pain at all time periods studied before and after TKA. Background: TKA is a very common surgery, but very little is known regarding the influence of impairments on functional limitations in this population. Methods and Measures: Forty subjects who underwent unilateral TKA followed by rehabilitation, including 6 weeks of outpatient physical therapy, were studied. Testing occurred at 5 time periods: preoperatively, and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Test measures included quadriceps strength, knee ROM, timed up-and-go test, timed stair-climbing test, bodily pain, and general health and knee function questionnaires. Results: Subjects experienced significant worsening of knee ROM, quadriceps strength, and performance on functional tests 1 month after surgery. Quadriceps strength went through the greatest decline of all the physical measures assessed and never matched the strength of the uninvolved limb. All measures underwent significant improvements following the 1-month test. Quadriceps strength was the most highly correlated measure associated with functional performance at all testing sessions. Conclusions: Functional measures underwent an expected decline early after TKA, but recovery was more rapid than anticipated and long-term outcomes were better than previously reported in the literature. The high correlation between quadriceps strength and functional performance suggests that improved postoperative quadriceps strengthening could be important to enhance the potential benefits of TKA.

The proposed neural network is proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converges globally to the optimal solution of the GLasso. It is also shown that the proposed neural solution can solve many optimization problems, including sparse and weighted sparse representations, (weighted) total variation denoising, fused lasso signal approximator, and trend filtering. Disparate experiments on the above problems illustrate and confirm the excellent performance of the proposed neural network in comparison to other competing techniques.},

Evaluations were made in subcutaneous (sc) AT and visceral (v) AT. Body weight increased over time in both groups (P , 0.001), but the increase was more pronounced in controls (P , 0.001) and food and fluid intake did not influence that effect. At the end of the experiment, aromatase expression increased in the AT (318.5 6 60.6\% of control in scAT, P , 0.05, and 285.5 6 82.9\% of control in vAT, P , 0.01). AT of GT-treated rats had a higher percentage of proliferating cells (204.1 6 19.5\% of control in scAT, P , 0.01, and 246.6 6 50.2\% of control in vAT, P , 0.01) and smaller adipocytes (78.3 6 1.7\% of control in scAT, P , 0.001, and 87.9 6 3.2\% of control in vAT, P , 0.05). GT also increased the number of apoptotic cells in vAT (320.4 6 21.9\% of control; P , 0.001). These results suggest new mechanisms for GT on body weight and highlight its potential benefit to prevent or treat obesity and the metabolic syndrome. J. Nutr. 138: 2156-2163, 2008.},

  abstract = {The skeletal wrist consists of eight small, intricately shaped carpal bones. The motion of these bones is complex, occurs in three dimensions, and remains incompletely defined. Our previous efforts have been focused on determining the in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) kinematics of the normal and abnormal carpus. In so doing we have developed an extensive database of carpal bone anatomy and kinematics from a large number of healthy subjects. The purpose of this paper is to describe that database and to make it available to other researchers. CT volume images of both wrists from 30 healthy volunteers (15 males and 15 females) were acquired in multiple wrist positions throughout the normal range of wrist motion. The outer cortical surfaces of the carpal bones, radius and ulna, and proximal metacarpals were segmented and the 3-D motion of each bone was calculated for each wrist position. The database was constructed to include high-resolution surface models, measures of bone volume and shape, and the 3-D kinematics of each segmented bone. The database does not include soft tissues of the wrist. While there are numerous digital anatomical databases, this one is unique in that it includes a large number of subjects and it contains in vivo kinematic data as well as the bony anatomy.},

The lack of such information for the elbow has motivated the present study. An attempt is therefore made to measure the rotatory component of cadaver elbows under passive motion. The results obtained will be used to Justify certain noninvasive means to measure three-dimensional angular motion for hving subjects. Using biplanar radiographs, cadaver forearms were studied under the passive motions of flexion-extensIOn and supination-pronation. The coordmate axes for the forearm, radius and ulna were defined based on imbedded Kirschner wires The three-dimensional rotation of the forearm with respect to the humerus, as well as the relative motion among the radius, ulna and humerus, were analyzed based on Eulerian angles. The relationship between the primary modes of motion and the inherent secondary motion was defined and analyzed. No translatIOnal motion within the joint was considered because of the tight constraint of the ligamentous structure. However, this hypothesis was exammed by momtoring the vanation of the displacement of the moving coordmate center The implications of these findings to the surgical treatment of elbow problems were speculated on.},

Previous investigators have used custom-built biplane fluoroscopes designed specifically for kinematic applications, which are available at few institutions and require FDA approval prior to clinical use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of an off-the-shelf clinical biplane fluoroscope for kinematic applications by validating model-based tracking for measurement of glenohumeral motion using an unmodified clinical system. Biplane images of each shoulder of a cadaver torso were acquired at various joint positions and during simulated movements along anatomical planes of motion. The pose of each humerus and scapula was determined using model-based tracking and compared to a bead-based gold standard. Error due to a temporal-offset between corresponding biplane images, characteristic of clinical biplane systems, was determined by comparison of measured and known relative position of 2 bead clusters of a phantom that was imaged while moved throughout the fluoroscopy image volume. Model-based tracking had global kinematic mean absolute errors of 0.27 mm and 0.29{\textdegree} (static), and 0.22{\textendash}0.32 mm and 0.12{\textendash}0.45{\textdegree} (dynamic). Glenohumeral mean absolute errors were 0.39 mm and 0.45{\textdegree} (static), and 0.36{\textendash}0.42 mm and 0.41{\textendash}0.48{\textdegree} (dynamic). The temporal-offset was predicted to add errors of 0.06{\textendash}0.85 mm and 0.05{\textendash}0.28{\textdegree} for cadaveric trials for the speeds examined. For defined speeds, sub-millimeter and sub-degree kinematic accuracy and precision were achieved using an unmodified clinical biplane fluoroscope for quantification of glenohumeral motion.},

The scheme is flexible as exemplified in pose grid design and slab binding, and upper bounds in projection error exist and can be estimated. Experiments were conducted to evaluate DRR quality and sensitivity to pose difference, computing time and error bounds were reported. The results showed that on a conventional computer the proposed scheme generated high quality, pose-preserving DRRs of size 512{\texttimes}512 in 6 ms with slab binding, demonstrating its potential to be a viable solution to fast, high quality DRR generation for 3D-2D image registration.},

Therapeutic properties of carvacrol have been demonstrated as anti-oxidant, anticancer, diabetes prevention, cardioprotective, anti-obesity, hepatoprotective and reproductive role, antiaging, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties. The carvacrol biosynthesis has been mediated through mevalonate pathway. Carvacrol has the anticancer ability against malignant cells via decreasing the expressions of matrix metalloprotease 2 and 9, inducing apoptosis, enhancing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, disrupting mitochondrial membrane, suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction, and also decreasing the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B. It also decreased the concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as also restored liver function, insulin level, and plasma glucose level. Carvacrol also has been found to exert antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Salmonella spp., Enterococcus sp.

The Slab algorithm is presented for illustration of the principle where projections of multiple slices for known poses are combined to form bigger slabs that are subsequently re-projected as unities and added together to compute DRRs for new poses. As there are only a small number of slabs to process, DRRs can be computed for new poses efficiently. Preliminary results showed that on a computer with an Intel Core2 Duo 2.8 GHz CPU, the algorithm generated full content DRRs of size 512{\texttimes}512 in 62 ms, with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) greater than 50 dB and high sensitivity to pose change, representing speedup in computation by a factor of 60 and demonstrating its potential to be a fast high quality DRR generation algorithm suited for image registration.},

  abstract = {Background: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has been well defined as the main passive restraint to anterior tibial translation (ATT) in the knee and plays an important role in rotational stability. However, it is unknown how closely the ACL and other passive and active structures of the knee constrain translations and rotations across a set of functional activities of increasing demand on the quadriceps. Hypothesis: Anterior tibial translation and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur would increase as the demand on the quadriceps increased. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The in vivo 3-dimensional knee kinematics of 10 adult female patients (height, 167.8 6 7.1 cm; body mass, 57 6 4 kg; body mass index [BMI], 24.8 6 1.7 kg/m2; age, 29.7 6 7.9 years) was measured using biplane fluoroscopy while patients completed 4 functional tasks. The tasks included an unloaded knee extension in which the patient slowly extended the knee from 90{\textdegree} to 0{\textdegree} of flexion in 2 seconds; walking at a constant pace of 90 steps per minute; a maximum effort isometric knee extension with the knee at 70{\textdegree} of flexion; and landing from a height of 40 cm in which the patient stepped off a box, landed, and immediately performed a maximum effort vertical jump. Results: Landing (5.6 6 1.9 mm) produced significantly greater peak ATT than walking (3.1 6 2.2 mm) and unweighted full extension (2.6 6 2.1 mm) (P {\textbackslash} .01), but there was no difference between landing and a maximum isometric contraction (5.0 6 1.9 mm). While there was no significant difference in peak internal rotation between landing (19.4{\textdegree} 6 5.7{\textdegree}), maximum isometric contraction (15.9{\textdegree} 6 6.7{\textdegree}), and unweighted full knee extension (14.5{\textdegree} 6 7.7{\textdegree}), each produced significantly greater internal rotation than walking (3.9{\textdegree} 6 4.2{\textdegree}) (P {\textbackslash} .001). Knee extension torque significantly increased for each task (P {\textbackslash} .01): unweighted knee extension (4.7 6 1.2 N{\'A}m), walking (36.5 6 7.9 N{\'A}m), maximum isometric knee extension (105.1 6 8.2 N{\'A}m), and landing (140.2 6 26.2 N{\'A}m). Conclusion: Anterior tibial translations significantly increased as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increased. Internal rotation was not significantly different between landing, isometric contraction, and unweighted knee extension. Additionally, ATT and internal rotation from each motion were within the normal range, and no excessive amounts of translation or rotation were observed. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrated that while ATT will increase as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increases, the knee is able to effectively constrain ATT and internal rotation. This suggests that the healthy knee has a safe envelope of function that is tightly controlled even though task demand is elevated.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI){\textendash}based 3-dimensional (3-D) bone shape predicts the onset of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods We conducted a case{\textendash}control study using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative by identifying knees that developed incident tibiofemoral radiographic knee OA (case knees) during followup, and matching them each to 2 random control knees. Using knee MRIs, we performed active appearance modeling of the femur, tibia, and patella and linear discriminant analysis to identify vectors that best classified knees with OA versus those without OA. Vectors were scaled such that -1 and +1 represented the mean non-OA and mean OA shapes, respectively. We examined the relation of 3-D bone shape to incident OA (new-onset Kellgren and Lawrence [K/L] grade {$\geq$}2) occurring 12 months later using conditional logistic regression. Results A total of 178 case knees (incident OA) were matched to 353 control knees. The whole joint (i.e., tibia, femur, and patella) 3-D bone shape vector had the strongest magnitude of effect, with knees in the highest tertile having a 3.0 times higher likelihood of developing incident radiographic knee OA 12 months later compared with those in the lowest tertile (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 1.8{\textendash}5.0, P {$<$} 0.0001). The associations were even stronger among knees that had completely normal radiographs before incidence (K/L grade of 0) (odds ratio 12.5 [95\% CI 4.0{\textendash}39.3]). Bone shape at baseline, often several years before incidence, predicted later OA. Conclusion MRI-based 3-D bone shape predicted the later onset of radiographic OA. Further study is warranted to determine whether such methods can detect treatment effects in trials and provide insight into the pathophysiology of OA development.},

Because the computational part of data analysis ultimately identifies shape characteristics in the organization of data sets, the mathematics of shape recognition in high dimensions continues to be a crucial part of data analysis. This article introduces a method that extracts information from high-throughput microarray data and, by using topology, provides greater depth of information than current analytic techniques. The method, termed Progression Analysis of Disease (PAD), first identifies robust aspects of cluster analysis, then goes deeper to find a multitude of biologically meaningful shape characteristics in these data. Additionally, because PAD incorporates a visualization tool, it provides a simple picture or graph that can be used to further explore these data. Although PAD can be applied to a wide range of high-throughput data types, it is used here as an example to analyze breast cancer transcriptional data. This identified a unique subgroup of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers that express high levels of c-MYB and low levels of innate inflammatory genes. These patients exhibit 100\% survival and no metastasis. No supervised step beyond distinction between tumor and healthy patients was used to identify this subtype. The group has a clear and distinct, statistically significant molecular signature, it highlights coherent biology but is invisible to cluster methods, and does not fit into the accepted classification of Luminal A/B, Normal-like subtypes of ER+ breast cancers. We denote the group as c-MYB+ breast cancer.},

Clinical image-based measures of bone mass show only moderate correlative strength with bone strength. However, engineering models derived from clinical image data predict bone strength with significantly greater accuracy. Currently, image-based finite element (FE) models are time consuming to construct and are non-parametric. The goal of this study was to develop a parametric proximal femur FE model based on a statistical shape and density model (SSDM) derived from clinical image data. A small number of independent SSDM parameters described the shape and bone density distribution of a set of cadaver femurs and captured the variability affecting proximal femur FE strength predictions. Finally, a three-dimensional FE model of an `unknown' femur was reconstructed from the SSDM with an average spatial error of 0.016mm and an average bon...},

  abstract = {Computational vision often needs to deal with derivatives of digital images. Such derivatives are not intrinsic properties of digital data; a paradigm is required to make them well-defined. Normally, a linear filtering is applied. This can be formulated in terms of scale-space, functional minimization, or edge detection filters. The main emphasis of this paper is to connect these theories in order to gain insight in their similarities and differences. We do not want, in this paper, to take part in any discussion of how edge detection must be performed, but will only link some of the current theories. We take regularization (or functional minimization) as a starting point, and show that it boils down to Gaussian scale-space if we require scale invariance and a semi-group constraint to be satisfied. This regularization implies the minimization of a functional containing terms up to infinite order of differentiation. If the functional is truncated at second order, the Canny-Deriche filter arises. It is also shown that higher dimensional regularization boils down to a rotated version of the one dimensional case, when Cartesian invariance is imposed and the image is vanishing at the borders. This means that the results from 1D regularization can be easily generalized to higher dimensions. Finally we show how an efficient implementation of regularization of order n can be made by recursive filtering using 2n multiplications and additions per output element without introducing any approximation.},

TDA also revealed that perioperative hypertension predicted long-term recovery better than any tested drug after thoracic SCI in rats.

The primary objectives were to introduce a new method for determining the optimal baseplate orientation to minimize bias error during MBRSA and to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the method using a knee positioning guide to repeatably orient the baseplate. A tibia phantom was rotated to achieve 24 different orientations with three pairs of radiographs acquired at each orientation. Radiographs were processed in MBRSA software and the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM), an indicator of bias error during model registration, was plotted as a function of the rotation angles to determine the optimal orientation and a range of acceptable orientations. The bias error decreased 85\% between the reference orientation and the optimal orientation. An acceptable range of orientations was defined by a decrease in bias error more than 50\%. Future researchers can use this method to determine the optimal orientation and a range of acceptable orientations for their specific baseplate to minimize bias error. Clinical usefulness was demonstrated by repeatedly imaging a knee model placed in a knee positioning guide (simulated clinical positioning) and demonstrating that the mean orientation {$\pm$} one standard deviation fell within the acceptable range of orientations. Thus, use of a knee positioning guide was an effective tool for repeatable patient positioning and should be considered for future RSA studies to maintain consistent positioning during a longitudinal study.},

It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pretraining tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to others also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.},

Carvacrol is reported to be lethally toxic to C. albicans, involving several potential mechanisms. However, the form and specific mechanism of cell death caused by this compound has not been delineated. In this study, we found that carvacrol could significantly decrease C. albicans survival rates, consistent with previous researches. Further examination proved that carvacrol treatment caused cell membrane permeability and depolarization. To elucidate the association between cell death and apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and metacaspase activation were determined; as expected, these two apoptosis-related markers were clearly observed. Moreover, total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated, and both mitochondrial transmembrane potential and morphology were disrupted. Additionally, cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium levels were also increased by carvacrol. Calcineurin inhibition experiments revealed cyclosporine A (CsA) addition notably rescued cell growth and inhibited metacaspase activation, indicating that carvacrol triggered C. albicans apoptosis through inducing calcineurin activation. Carvacrol was demonstrated to both have low toxicity and be effective in alleviating systemic infections with C. albicans, which might be via its antifungal and immunomodulation activities. This study suggests that carvacrol has excellent potential as a natural protective compound against C. albicans infections.},

This study's purpose was to determine if a contemporary total knee arthroplasty design improved functional knee flexion compared with a traditional total knee arthroplasty in patients living a Western lifestyle. Ten patients with bilateral total knee arthroplasty of 2 types were studied during weight-bearing lunge, kneeling, and stair activities using fluoroscopic imaging. There were no differences in maximum knee flexion during lunging or kneeling. Statistically significant differences in tibial rotation and condylar translation were observed during the 3 activities. Although several joint kinematic differences were observed, no important functional differences were observed in clinically excellent, high performing subjects with bilateral total knee arthroplasty of 2 types. Keywords: total knee arthroplasty, kinematics, maximum flexion, prosthetic design, fluoroscopy.},

We demonstrate how this model can execute a range of tasks such as generating analogues to a query structure and generating compounds predicted to be active against a biological target. As a proof of principle, the model is first trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example, the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor type 2, the model generates structures of which more than 95\% are predicted to be active, including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the current trends and use of rTSA, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), and hemiarthroplasty (HA) from 2011 to 2014. Shoulder arthroplasty data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample database were analyzed for the years 2011 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. For each procedure, use and patient and hospital characteristics were identified. Shoulder arthroplasties increased by 24\% between 2011 and 2014, to 79,105 procedures. The proportion of arthroplasties that were aTSA did not change substantially (44\% for both years; P=.0585), while the proportion that were rTSA surpassed aTSA in 2014, increasing from 33\% to 46\% (P{$<$}.0001). Use of rTSA topped use of aTSA by 2013 for Medicare patients. The proportion that were HA procedures declined from 23\% to 11\% (P{$<$}.0001). The use of rTSA for fracture increased from 26\% to 58\% (P{$<$}.0001) of all arthroplasties for this indication, while the use of HA for fracture decreased from 69\% to 40\% (P{$<$}.0001). Orthopedists performed rTSA more often than aTSA for Medicare patients by 2013 and the general population by 2014. The use of rTSA for fracture has grown significantly, with rTSA being performed more frequently than HA for this indication. [Orthopedics. 2018; 41(3):e416{\textendash}e423.]},

Two important determinants of knee kinematics are component geometry and the presence or absence of a posterior-stabilising mechanism (cam-post). We investigated the influence of these variables by comparing the kinematics of a TKR with a polyradial femur with a single radius design, both with and without a cam-post mechanism.             We assessed 55 patients, subdivided into four groups, who had undergone a TKR one year earlier by using an established fluoroscopy protocol in order to examine their kinematics in vivo. The kinematic profile was obtained by measuring the patellar tendon angle through the functional knee flexion range (0{\textdegree} to 90{\textdegree}) and the results compared with 14 normal knees. All designs of TKR had abnormal sagittal kinematics compared with the normal knee. There was a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) difference between those of the two TKRs near to full extension. The presence of the cam-post mechanism did not influence the kinematics for either TKR design. These differences suggest that surface geometry is a stronger determinant of kinematics than the presence or absence of a cam-post mechanism for these two designs. This may be because the cam-post mechanism is ineffective.},

Clinical practice guidelines typically define a set of recommendations together with eligibility criteria that restrict their applicability to a specific group of patients. The ever-growing size and availability of health-related data is currently challenging the broad definitions of guideline-defined patient groups. Precision medicine leverages on genetic, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics to provide precise identification of patient subsets for treatment targeting. Defining a patient similarity measure is thus an essential step to allow stratification of patients into clinically-meaningful subgroups. The present review investigates the use of patient similarity as a tool to enable precision medicine. 279 articles were analyzed along four dimensions: data types considered, clinical domains of application, data analysis methods, and translational stage of findings. Cancer-related research employing molecular profiling and standard data analysis techniques such as clustering constitute the majority of the retrieved studies. Chronic and psychiatric diseases follow as the second most represented clinical domains. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the studies analyzed presented a novel methodology, with the most advanced employing data integration strategies and being portable to different clinical domains. Integration of such techniques into decision support systems constitutes and interesting trend for future research.},

OA is a multifactorial disorder accompanied by biochemical and morphological changes in the articular cartilage, modulated by skeletal biomechanics and gait. While we can now acquire detailed information about the knee joint structure and function, we are not yet able to leverage the multifactorial factors for diagnosis and disease management of knee OA. Materials and Methods We mapped 178 subjects in a multidimensional space integrating: demographic, clinical information, gait kinematics and kinetics, cartilage compositional T1{$\rho$} and T2 and R2-R1{$\rho$} (1/T2{\textendash}1/T1{$\rho$}) acquired at 3T and whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score morphological grading. Topological data analysis (TDA) and Kolmogorov{\textendash}Smirnov test were adopted for data integration, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Regression models were used for hypothesis testing. Results The results of the TDA showed a network composed of three main patient subpopulations, thus potentially identifying new phenotypes. T2 and T1{$\rho$} values (T2 lateral femur P = 1.45*10-8, T1{$\rho$} medial tibia P = 1.05*10-5), the presence of femoral cartilage defects (P = 0.0013), lesions in the meniscus body (P = 0.0035), and race (P = 2.44*10-4) were key markers in the subpopulation classification. Within one of the subpopulations we observed an association between the composite metric R2-R1{$\rho$} and the longitudinal progression of cartilage lesions. Conclusion The analysis presented demonstrates some of the complex multitissue biochemical and biomechanical interactions that define joint degeneration and OA using a multidimensional approach, and potentially indicates that R2-R1{$\rho$} may be an imaging biomarker for early OA.

Many recent works have shown that a two-stage approach, which first detects keypoints and then solves a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose estimation, achieves remarkable performance. However, most of these methods only localize a set of sparse keypoints by regressing their image coordinates or heatmaps, which are sensitive to occlusion and truncation. Instead, we introduce a Pixel-wise Voting Network (PVNet) to regress pixel-wise unit vectors pointing to the keypoints and use these vectors to vote for keypoint locations using RANSAC. This creates a flexible representation for localizing occluded or truncated keypoints. Another important feature of this representation is that it provides uncertainties of keypoint locations that can be further leveraged by the PnP solver. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on the LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCBVideo datasets by a large margin, while being efficient for real-time pose estimation. We further create a Truncation LINEMOD dataset to validate the robustness of our approach against truncation. The code will be avaliable at https://zju-3dv.github.io/pvnet/.},

In this representation the rotation is itself represented as a three-dimensional vector. The vector is parallel to the axis of rotation and its three components transform covariantly on change of coordinates. The mapping from rotations to vectors is 1:1 apart from computation error. The discontinuities of the representation require special handling but are not problematic. The rotation matrix can be generated efficiently from the vector without the use of transcendental functions, and vice-versa. The representation is more efficient than Euler angles, has affinities with Hassenpflug's Argyris angles and is very closely related to the quaternion representation. While the quaternion representation avoids the discontinuities inherent in any 3-component representation, this problem is readily overcome. The present paper gives efficient algorithms for computing the set of rotations which map a given vector to another of the same length and the rotation which maps a given pair of vectors to another pair of the same length and subtended angle.},

This paper begins with a brief introduction to an automated three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical gait data collection system: 3D GAIT, followed by how the studies in the field of gait biomechanics fit the quantities in the 5V's definition of big data: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. Next, we provide a review of recent research and development in multivariate and machine learning methods-based gait analysis that can be applied to big data analytics. These modern biomechanical gait analysis methods include several main modules such as initial input features, dimensionality reduction (feature selection and extraction), and learning algorithms (classification and clustering).

  abstract = {Muscle volume is a useful quantitative biomarker in sports, but also for the follow-up of degenerative musculo-skelletal diseases. In addition to volume, other shape biomarkers can be extracted by segmenting the muscles of interest from medical images. Manual segmentation is still today the gold standard for such measurements despite being very time-consuming. We propose a method for automatic segmentation of 18 muscles of the lower limb on 3D Magnetic Resonance Images to assist such morphometric analysis. By their nature, the tissue of different muscles is undistinguishable when observed in MR Images. Thus, muscle segmentation algorithms cannot rely on appearance but only on contour cues. However, such contours are hard to detect and their thickness varies across subjects. To cope with the above challenges, we propose a segmentation approach based on a hybrid architecture, combining convolutional and visual transformer blocks. We investigate for the first time the behaviour of such hybrid architectures in the context of muscle segmentation for shape analysis. Considering the consistent anatomical muscle configuration, we rely on transformer blocks to capture the longrange relations between the muscles. To further exploit the anatomical priors, a second contribution of this work consists in adding a regularisation loss based on an adjacency matrix of plausible muscle neighbourhoods estimated from the training data. Our experimental results on a unique database of elite athletes show it is possible to train complex hybrid models from a relatively small database of large volumes, while the anatomical prior regularisation favours better predictions.},

Methods: From May 2007 to December 2012, 18,065 primary TKAs performed on 16,083 patients at a single institution were recorded in a prospective total joint arthroplasty registry with a minimum of 5-year follow-up. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts to determine a cause of failure for primary TKAs. A cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the risk of revision surgery following primary TKA. Results: The most common reasons for failure within 2 years after TKA were infection and stiffness. The multivariable regression identified the following preoperative risk factors for TKA failure: history of drug abuse (hazard ratio [HR] 4.68; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03), deformity/mechanical preoperative diagnosis (HR 3.52; P {$<$} .01), having a constrained condylar knee implant over posterior-stabilized implant (HR 1.99; P {$<$} .01), post-traumatic/trauma preoperative diagnosis (HR 1.78; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .03), and younger age (HR 0.61; P {$<$} .01) Conclusion: These findings add to the growing data that primary TKAs are no longer failing from polyethylene wear-related issues. This study identified preoperative risk factors for failure of primary TKAs, which may be useful information for developing strategies to improve outcomes following TKA.},

  abstract = {Background. Investigating modifiable factors that contribute to functional limitations in patients with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may guide changes in rehabilitation protocols and improve functional outcomes. Whereas quadriceps muscle weakness has been demonstrated to contribute to functional limitations in TKA, the role of hip abductor weakness has not received attention. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hip abductor strength (force-generating capacity) contributes to physical function beyond what can be explained by quadriceps muscle strength in patients after a TKA. Design. A cross-sectional design was used in the study. Setting. The study was conducted in a clinical laboratory at an academic center. Patients. Thirty-one people with TKA (74\% female; mean ageϭ68 years, SDϭ8; mean body mass indexϭ31 kg/m2, SDϭ5) participated in the study. Measurements. Strength of quadriceps muscles and hip abductors was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Performance-based physical function was assessed with 4 measures: self-selected walking speed, the Figure-of-8 Walk Test, the Stair Ascend/Descend Test, and the 5-Chair Rise Test. Self-reported physical function was assessed with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Physical Function Subscale. Results. In hierarchical regression models, after accounting for demographic and anthropometric factors, quadriceps muscle strength was associated with performance on the Stair Ascend/Descend Test. After accounting for demographic, anthropometric, and quadriceps strength, hip abductor strength was associated with performance on the Stair Ascend/Descend Test, the Figure-of-8 Walk Test, and the 5-Chair Rise Test. Limitations. The study design precluded ascertainment of causal relationships. Conclusions. After TKA, hip abductor strength influenced physical function in participants more than did demographic or anthropometric measures or quadriceps strength. Longitudinal studies with larger samples are warranted. If findings are replicated, they will justify targeting the hip abductors during rehabilitation after TKA.},

  abstract = {A number of methods have been developed to examine the morphologic, biochemical, and molecular changes that happen during the DNA damage response that may ultimately lead to death of cells through various mechanisms that include apoptosis. When cells are exposed to ionizing radiation or chemical DNA-damaging agents, double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB) are generated that rapidly result in the phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX. Because phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser 139 correlates well with each DSB, phospho-H2AX is a sensitive marker to used to examine the DNA damage and its repair. Apoptotic cells are characterized on the basis of their reduced DNA content and morphologic changes, including nuclear condensation, which can be detected by flow cytometry (sub-G1 DNA content), trypan blue, or Hoechst staining. The appearance of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane with annexin V{\textendash}fluorochrome conjugates indicates the changes in plasma membrane composition and function. By combining it with propidium iodide staining, this method can also be used to distinguish early versus late apoptotic or necrotic events. The activation of caspases is another well-known biochemical marker of apoptosis. Finally, the Bcl-2 family of proteins and the mitochondria that play a critical role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis can be examined by translocation of Bax and cytochrome c in and out of mitochondria. In this chapter, we discuss the most commonly used techniques used in our laboratory for determining the DNA damage response leading to apoptosis.},

It can also be used for accurate determinations of drug sensitivity but only if a quantitative relationship is established between cell number and MTT-formazan production. We have shown that reduction of MTT to MTT-formazan by cells is dependent on the amount of MTT in the incubation medium. The concentration required to give maximal MTT-formazan production differs widely between cell lines. The absorption spectrum of MTT-formazan varies with cell number and with pH. At a low cell density or a high pH, the absorption maximum is at a wavelength of 560 to 570 nm. However, at a high cell density or a low pH, there are two absorption maxima; one at 510 nm and a second at about 570 nm. Measurements of absorbance at 570 nm underestimate MTT-formazan production and, hence, cell number at high cell densities. This error can result in a 10-fold underestimation of chemosensitivity. Addition of a buffer at pH 10.5 to the solubilized MTT-formazan product can overcome the effects of both cell density and culture medium on the absorption spectrum. Provided that sufficient MTT is used and the pH of the MTT-formazan product is controlled, dye reduction can be used to estimate cell numbers in a simple chemosensitivity assay the results of which agree well with a commonly used clonogenic assay.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite reasonable accuracy with preoperative templating, the search for an optimal planning tool remains an unsolved dilemma. The purpose of the present study was to apply machine learning (ML) using preoperative demographic variables to predict mismatch between templating and final component size in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) cases. Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study of primary TKA patients between September 2012 and April 2018. The primary outcome was mismatch between the templated and final implanted component sizes extracted from the operative database. The secondary outcome was mismatch categorized as undersized and oversized. Five supervised ML algorithms were trained using 6 demographic features. Prediction accuracies were obtained as a metric of performance for binary mismatch (yes/no) and multilevel (undersized/correct/oversized) classifications. Results: A total of 1801 patients were included. For binary classification, the best-performing algorithm for predicting femoral and tibial mismatch was the stochastic gradient boosting model (area under the curve: 0.76/0.72, calibration intercepts: 0.05/0.05, calibration slopes: 0.55/0.7, and Brier scores: 0.20/0.21). For multiclass classification, the best-performing algorithms had accuracies of 83.9\% and 82.9\% for predicting the concordance/mismatch of the femoral and tibial implant, respectively. Model predictions of greater than 51.0\% and 47.9\% represented high-risk thresholds for femoral and tibial sizing mismatch, respectively. Conclusions: ML algorithms predicted templating mismatch with good accuracy. External validation is necessary to confirm the performance and reliability of these algorithms. Predicting sizing mismatch is the first step in using ML to aid in the prediction of final TKA component sizes. Further studies to optimize parameters and predictions for the algorithms are ongoing.},

METHODS:A systematic review was conducted (Prospero CRD42018082708). PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched using relevant keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The quality of the articles was evaluated using a customized scale. RESULTS:Thirty articles were included, 6 of which included pathological muscles. Most evaluated lower limb muscles. Partially or completely automatic and manual techniques were assessed in 10 and 24 articles, respectively. Manual slice-by-slice segmentation reliability was good-to-excellent (n = 8 articles) and validity against dissection was moderate to good(n = 1). Manual slice-by-slice segmentation was used as a gold-standard method in the other articles. Reduction of the number of manually segmented slices (n = 6) provided good to excellent validity if a sufficient number of appropriate slices was chosen. Segmentation on one slice (n = 11) increased volume errors. The Deformation of a Parametric Specific Object (DPSO) method (n = 5) decreased the number of manually-segmented slices required for any chosen level of error. Other automatic techniques combined with different statistical shape or atlas/images-based methods (n = 4) had good validity. Some particularities were highlighted for specific muscles. Except for manual slice by slice segmentation, reliability has rarely been reported. CONCLUSIONS:The results of this systematic review help the choice of appropriate segmentation techniques, according to the purpose of the measurement. In healthy populations, techniques that greatly simplified the process of manual segmentation yielded greater errors in volume and shape estimations. Reduction of the number of manually segmented slices was possible with appropriately chosen segmented slices or with DPSO. Other automatic techniques showed promise, but data were insufficient for their validation. More data on the metrological quality of techniques used in the cases of muscle pathology are required.},

On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks{\textemdash}generative and predictive{\textemdash}that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo{\textendash}generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.},

Blinded reviewers conducted multiple screens. All included studies were graded based on the level of evidence, and data concerning patient demographics and postoperative outcomes were extracted. {$<$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$>$} A total of 11 articles were included, including one level I article, three level III articles, and seven level IV articles. The review consisted of 720 patients and 731 shoulders (320 women and 157 men), with a mean age of 72.4 years. A single deltopectoral approach was performed for a majority of studies (627/731 shoulders), followed by a superolateral approach (70/731 shoulders) and a single transdeltoid approach (4/731 patients). Eleven studies reported data specifically about preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff musculature; the teres minor was studied most widely (298/731 shoulders), followed by the subscapularis (256/731 shoulders) and infraspinatus (232/731 shoulders). The Constant score (562/731 shoulders) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (284/731 shoulders) were the most common recorded outcome scores. Fatty infiltration of the teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus was associated with worse range of motion after rTSA. {$<$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$>$} Preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff, particularly of the teres minor and infraspinatus, has a negative impact on subjective patient outcomes and restoration of range of motion, especially external rotation, after rTSA. The impact of fatty infiltration of the other rotator cuff muscles remains unclear, which may be due to intersurgeon differences in the handling of the remaining rotator cuff muscles or differences in implant design. The evaluated literature provides information on which patients can be educated about probable outcomes and restoration of function after rTSA.},

  abstract = {Background: The authors investigated type and severity of cognitive decline in older adults immediately and 3 months after noncardiac surgery. Changes in instrumental activities of daily living were examined relative to type of cognitive decline. Methods: Of the initial 417 older adults enrolled in the study, 337 surgery patients and 60 controls completed baseline, discharge, and/or 3-month postoperative cognitive and instrumental activities of daily living measures. Reliable change methods were used to examine three types of cognitive decline: memory, executive function, and combined executive function/ memory. SD cutoffs were used to grade severity of change as mild, moderate or severe. Results: At discharge, 186 (56\%) patients experienced cognitive decline, with an equal distribution in type and severity. At 3 months after surgery, 231 patients (75.1\%) experienced no cognitive decline, 42 (13.6\%) showed only memory decline, 26 (8.4\%) showed only executive function decline, and 9 (2.9\%) showed decline in both executive and memory domains. Of those with cognitive decline, 36 (46.8\%) had mild, 25 (32.5\%) had moderate, and 16 (20.8\%) had severe decline. The combined group had more severe impairment. Executive function or combined (memory and executive) deficits involved greater levels of functional (i.e., instrumental activities of daily living) impairment. The combined group was less educated than the unimpaired and memory groups. Conclusion: Postsurgical cognitive presentation varies with time of testing. At 3 months after surgery, more older adults experienced memory decline, but only those with executive or combined cognitive decline had functional limitations. The findings have relevance for patients and caregivers. Future research should examine how perioperative factors influence neuronal systems.},

Most commonly, a single-plane fluoroscopic setup is used to capture the motion of prostheses during a particular task. Unfortunately, single-plane fluoroscopic analysis is imprecise in the out-of-plane direction. This can result in reconstructing physically impossible poses, in which{\textemdash}for example{\textemdash}the femoral component intersects with the insert, as the normal pose estimation process does not take into account the relation between the components. In the proposed method, the poses of both components are estimated simultaneously, while preventing femur{\textendash}insert collisions. In a phantom study, the accuracy and precision of the new method in estimating the relative pose of the femoral component were compared to those of the original method. With reverse engineered models, the errors in estimating the out-of-plane position decreased from 2.0 7 0.7 to 0.1 7 0.1 mm, without effects on the errors in rotations and the in-plane positions. With CAD models, the errors in estimating the out-ofplane position decreased from 5.3 70.7 mm (mean 7 SD) to 0.0 7 0.4 mm, at the expense of a decreased precision for the other position or orientation parameters. In conclusion, collision detection can prevent reconstructing impossible poses and it improves the position and motion estimation in the out-of-plane direction.},

The model-based approach, which does not require these markers, is, however, less precise. One of the reasons may be the fact that the spherical head has not been modelled. Therefore, we added a 3D surface model of the spherical head and estimated the position and orientation of the combined stem{\textendash}head model. The new method using a combined stem{\textendash}head model was compared in a phantom study on five prostheses (of different types) and in a clinical study using double examinations of implanted hip prostheses, with two existing methods: a standard model-based approach and one using elementary geometrical shapes. The combined model showed the highest precision for the rotation about the longitudinal axis in the phantom experiments. With a standard deviation of 0.691 it showed a significant improvement (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02) over the model-based approach (0.961) on the phantom data, but no improvement on the clinical data. Overall, the use of elementary geometrical shapes was worse with respect to the modelbased approach, with a standard deviation of 1.021 on the phantom data and 0.791 on the clinical data. This decrease in precision was significant (po0.01) on the clinical data. With relatively small differences in the other migration directions, these results demonstrate that the new method with a combined stem{\textendash}head model can be a useful alternative to the standard model-based approach.},

However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.},

Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art.

Specifically, to activate the transformer's strong capability in representing features, we develop a new variant of a multi-head self-attention structure to enhance both point-wise and channel-wise relations of the feature map. In addition, we leverage a positional fusion block to comprehensively capture the local context of point cloud data, providing more position-related information about the scattered points. As the first transformer model introduced for point cloud upsampling, we demonstrate the outstanding performance of our approach by comparing with the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods on different benchmarks quantitatively and qualitatively.},

Eighteen patients who had mobile-bearing prostheses and 17 patients with fixed-bearing knee prostheses experienced a normal pattern of axial rotation of 7.3{\textdegree} and 4.1{\textdegree} respectively. Eleven of 20 (55\%) patients who had mobile-bearing prostheses implanted and eight of 20 (40\%) patients who had fixed-bearing prostheses implanted did not experience femoral condylar lift-off. The remaining knees had condylar liftoff less than 2.4 mm for fixed-bearing prostheses and 1.7 mm for mobile-bearing prostheses, respectively. Patients who had mobilebearing prostheses implanted experienced greater axial rotation and less condylar lift-off than patients who had fixed-bearing prostheses implanted. Both cruciate ligaments are sacrificed for the mobile and fixed-bearing total knee replacements.

The objective of this review is to discuss the adipocyte life cycle and various dietary bioactives that target different stages of adipocyte life cycle. Different stages of adipocyte development include preadipocytes, maturing preadipocytes and mature adipocytes. Various dietary bioactives like genistein, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), docosahexaenoic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, resveratrol and ajoene affect adipocytes during specific stages of development, resulting in either inhibition of adipogenesis or induction of apoptosis. Although numerous molecular targets that can be used for both treatment and prevention of obesity have been identified, targeted monotherapy has resulted in lack of success. Thus, targeting several signal transduction pathways simultaneously with multiple natural products to achieve additive or synergistic effects might be an appropriate approach to address obesity. We have previously reported two such combinations, namely, ajoene+CLA and vitamin D+genistein. CLA enhanced ajoene-induced apoptosis in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes by synergistically increasing the expression of several proapoptotic factors. Similarly, genistein potentiated vitamin D's inhibition of adipogenesis and induction of apoptosis in maturing preadipocytes by an enhanced expression of VDR (vitamin D receptor) protein. These two examples indicate that combination therapy employing compounds that target different stages of the adipocyte life cycle might prove beneficial for decreasing adipose tissue volume by inducing apoptosis or by inhibiting adipogenesis or both.},

While the anti-cancer properties of resveratrol have been extensively investigated, the antiadipogenic and osteogenic effects of resveratrol are also gaining considerable interest. The finding that resveratrol supplementation mimics caloric restriction prompted researchers to study the effects of resveratrol on lipid metabolism. Mesenchymal stem cells are the precursors for both adipocytes and osteoblasts. In the aging population, differentiation to adipocytes dominates over the differentiation to osteoblasts in bone marrow, contributing to the increased tendency for fractures to occur in the elderly. Thus, an inverse relationship exists between adipocytes and osteoblasts in the bone marrow. Resveratrol acts on several molecular targets in adipocytes and osteoblasts leading to a decrease in adipocyte number and size and an increase in osteogenesis. Furthermore, resveratrol in combination with genistein and quercetin synergistically decreased adipogenesis in murine and human adipocytes. A recent in vivo study showed that phytochemicals including resveratrol in combination with vitamin D prevented weight gain and bone loss in a postmenopausal rat model. Therefore, combinations of resveratrol with other phytochemicals may lead to potential novel potent therapies for both obesity and osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {While the importance of automatic image analysis is continuously increasing, recent meta-research revealed major flaws with respect to algorithm validation. Performance metrics are particularly key for meaningful, objective, and transparent performance assessment and validation of the used automatic algorithms, but relatively little attention has been given to the practical pitfalls when using specific metrics for a given image analysis task. These are typically related to (1) the disregard of inherent metric properties, such as the behaviour in the presence of class imbalance or small target structures, (2) the disregard of inherent data set properties, such as the non-independence of the test cases, and (3) the disregard of the actual biomedical domain interest that the metrics should reflect. This living dynamically document has the purpose to illustrate important limitations of performance metrics commonly applied in the field of image analysis. In this context, it focuses on biomedical image analysis problems that can be phrased as image-level classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, or object detection task. The current version is based on a Delphi process on metrics conducted by an international consortium of image analysis experts from more than 60 institutions worldwide.},

  abstract = {Validation metrics are key for the reliable tracking of scientific progress and for bridging the current chasm between artificial intelligence (AI) research and its translation into practice. However, increasing evidence shows that particularly in image analysis, metrics are often chosen inadequately in relation to the underlying research problem. This could be attributed to a lack of accessibility of metric-related knowledge: While taking into account the individual strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of validation metrics is a critical prerequisite to making educated choices, the relevant knowledge is currently scattered and poorly accessible to individual researchers. Based on a multi-stage Delphi process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert consortium as well as extensive community feedback, the present work provides the first reliable and comprehensive common point of access to information on pitfalls related to validation metrics in image analysis. Focusing on biomedical image analysis but with the potential of transfer to other fields, the addressed pitfalls generalize across application domains and are categorized according to a newly created, domain-agnostic taxonomy. To facilitate comprehension, illustrations and specific examples accompany each pitfall. As a structured body of information accessible to researchers of all levels of expertise, this work enhances global comprehension of a key topic in image analysis validation.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional models of bone structures, inferred from 3D and 2D imaging modalities, provide a number of uses for medical professionals. Such models are typically constructed using mesh-based approaches and some form of principal component analysis (PCA). Image-based approaches are understood to have a number of advantages over mesh-based ones, such as the absence of intrinsic segmentation as well as a better reproduction fidelity. Furthermore, Gaussian process morphable models have recently been shown to offer added benefits to the traditional PCA-based approach, such as the ability to easily incorporate prior knowledge into the model, and a resolution that can be made application-specific. We demonstrate how to build an image-based statistical shape and intensity model (SSIM) using Gaussian process morphable models and validate the quality of the model using common mesh model metrics that we adapt to the image-based paradigm. Our results show that the model can generate valid novel femur examples and can be registered to unseen femur examples with average root mean square error and average mutual information score of 0.172 and 0.644, respectively. However, only twenty binary training examples are used, each limited to contain approximately 65000 voxels. Future work will aim at extending the image-based SSIM to include the full range of CT intensity values; larger CT volumes and improve on the model building time.},

Two-dimensional-to-3-D (2-D/3-D) reconstruction, also known as model-to-modality or atlas-based 2-D/3-D registration, provides a means of obtaining a 3-D model of a patient's bones from their 2-D radiographs when 3-D imaging modalities are not available. The preferred approach for estimating both shape and density information (that would be present in a patient's computed tomography data) for 2-D/3-D reconstruction makes use of digitally reconstructed radiographs and deformable models in an iterative, non-rigid, intensity-based approach. Based on a large number of state-of-the-art 2-D/3-D bone reconstruction methods, a unified mathematical formulation of the problem is proposed in a common conceptual framework, using unambiguous terminology. In addition, shortcomings, recent adaptations, and persisting challenges are discussed along with insights for future research.},

The 1970s were selected because most innovations occurred during those years. Two different design approaches were undertaken simultaneously. One was a functional approach whereas the other was a strictly anatomical approach. Initially, these 2 approaches led to very different designs. But the common goal of recreating human knee function eventually led to more similarities than differences. The author describes how, when, and why these dedicated individuals came to their ideas. The work is largely based on interviews and correspondence with those involved as well as on reviews of patents and papers pertaining to their work.

The mean Dice similarity coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and relative area difference for the segmented lesion, measuring the similarity of clinician assessment and that of a deep neural network, were 0.97, 99.84, 96.89, 99.92, and 0.07, respectively, for the supraspinatus fossa and 0.94, 99.89, 93.34, 99.95, and 2.03, respectively, for the supraspinatus muscle. The fatty infiltration measure using the Otsu thresholding method significantly differed among the Goutallier grades (Grade 0; 0.06, Grade 1; 4.68, Grade 2; 20.10, Grade 3; 42.86, Grade 4; 55.79, p{$<$}0.0001).

This study included 240 randomly selected patients who underwent shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from January 2015 to December 2016.  We used a fully convolutional deep-learning algorithm to quantitatively detect the fossa and muscle regions by measuring the occupation ratio of the supraspinatus muscle. Fatty infiltration was objectively evaluated using the Otsu thresholding method. The proposed convolutional neural network exhibited fast and accurate segmentation of the supraspinatus muscle and fossa from shoulder MRI, allowing automatic calculation of the occupation ratio. Quantitative evaluation using a modified Otsu thresholding method can be used to calculate the proportion of fatty infiltration in the supraspinatus muscle. We expect that this will improve the efficiency and objectivity of diagnoses by quantifying the index used for shoulder MRI.},

It does not require any precomputation time, nor does it make any prior assumptions of the patient pose that would limit the permissible range of patient motion. We use a cylindrical attenuation field parameterization, which is better suited for medical 2D-3D registration than the usual two-plane parameterization. The computed attenuation values are stored in a hash table for time-efficient storage and access. Using a clinical gold-standard spine image dataset, we demonstrate a speedup of 2D-3D image registration by a factor of four over ray-casting DRR with no decrease of registration accuracy or robustness.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted disease with many variables affecting diagnosis and progression. Topological data analysis (TDA) is a state-of-the-art big data analytics tool that can combine all variables into multidimensional space. TDA is used to simultaneously analyze imaging and gait analysis techniques. PURPOSE: To identify biochemical and biomechanical biomarkers able to classify different disease progression phenotypes in subjects with and without radiographic signs of hip OA. STUDY TYPE: Longitudinal study for comparison of progressive and nonprogressive subjects. POPULATION: In all, 102 subjects with and without radiographic signs of hip osteoarthritis. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T, SPGR 3D MAPSS T1{$\rho$} /T2 , intermediate-weighted fat-suppressed fast spin-echo (FSE). ASSESSMENT: Multidimensional data analysis including cartilage composition, bone shape, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification of osteoarthritis, scoring hip osteoarthritis with MRI (SHOMRI), hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS). STATISTICAL TESTS: Analysis done using TDA, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) testing, and Benjamini-Hochberg to rank P-value results to correct for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Subjects in the later stages of the disease had an increased SHOMRI score (P{$<$}0.0001), increased KL (P=0.0012), and older age (P{$<$}0.0001). Subjects in the healthier group showed intact cartilage and less pain. Subjects found between these two groups had a range of symptoms. Analysis of this subgroup identified knee biomechanics (P{$<$}0.0001) as an initial marker of the disease that is noticeable before the morphological progression and degeneration. Further analysis of an OA subgroup with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) showed anterior labral tears to be the most significant marker (P=0.0017) between those FAI subjects with and without OA symptoms. DATA CONCLUSION: The data-driven analysis obtained with TDA proposes new phenotypes of these subjects that partially overlap with the radiographic-based classical disease status classification and also shows the potential for further examination of an early onset biomechanical intervention.

  abstract = {Validated computational models promise a virtual platform to create optimal articular surfaces that best achieve desired implant characteristics. Today, designers can parametrically define the primary geometric features of an implant, and automatically modify design variables until stability/mobility performance objectives are best achieved. This preclinical, virtual design iteration minimizes the development cycle compared with testing physical prototypes and, by evaluating a broader scope of design concepts, likely improves the clinical performance of the final product. However, the scenario described is not without shortcomings and requires thorough understanding of the capabilities and the limitations of the models used. Although models typically represent the articular interface well, the interaction with the patient and the surgical process includes significant variability and increase in complexity. We present current modeling capabilities for the estimation of implant stability/mobility, with further suggestions for answering the difficult question of how an implant might perform throughout the population.},

In particular, considering the biomedical field, quantitative imaging methods are increasingly gaining importance since they convey scientifically and clinically relevant information for prediction, prognosis, and treatment response assessment. In this context, radiomic approaches are fostering large-scale studies that can have a significant impact in the clinical practice. In this work, we focus on Haralick features, the most common and clinically relevant descriptors. These features are based on the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), whose computation is considerably intensive on images characterized by a high bit-depth (e.g., 16 bits), as in the case of medical images that convey detailed visual information. We propose here HaraliCU, an efficient strategy for the computation of the GLCM and the extraction of an exhaustive set of the Haralick features. HaraliCU was conceived to exploit the parallel computation capabilities of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), allowing us to achieve up to {$\sim$} 20{\texttimes} speed-up with respect to the corresponding C++ coded sequential version. Our GPU-powered solution highlights the promising capabilities of GPUs in the clinical research.},

  abstract = {Generation of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) is computationally expensive and is typically the rate-limiting step in the execution time of intensity-based two-dimensional to three-dimensional (2D-3D) registration algorithms. We address this computational issue by extending the technique of light field rendering from the computer graphics community. The extension of light fields, which we call attenuation fields (AFs), allows most of the DRR computation to be performed in a preprocessing step; after this precomputation step, DRRs can be generated substantially faster than with conventional ray casting. We derive expressions for the physical sizes of the two planes of an AF necessary to generate DRRs for a given X-ray camera geometry and all possible object motion within a specified range. Because an AF is a ray-based data structure, it is substantially more memory efficient than a huge table of precomputed DRRs because it eliminates the redundancy of replicated rays. Nonetheless, an AF can require substantial memory, which we address by compressing it using vector quantization. We compare DRRs generated using AFs (AF-DRRs) to those generated using ray casting (RC-DRRs) for a typical C-arm geometry and computed tomography images of several anatomic regions. They are quantitatively very similar: the median peak signal-to-noise ratio of AF-DRRs versus RC-DRRs is greater than 43 dB in all cases. We perform intensity-based 2D-3D registration using AF-DRRs and RC-DRRs and evaluate registration accuracy using gold-standard clinical spine image data from four patients. The registration accuracy and robustness of the two methods is virtually identical whereas the execution speed using AF-DRRs is an order of magnitude faster.},

Accurate knowledge of kinematics is valuable for implant design, comparisons between designs or surgical techniques, and to identify differences between patients with good and poor outcomes. Both static and dynamic imaging techniques have been used to evaluate kinematics. In general, static imaging is used to capture better quality images or to capture views that cannot be acquired by dynamic imaging, whereas dynamic imaging is used to capture reallife movements. How well static kinematics represent dynamic kinematics is subject to frequent debate and has not been adequately addressed, especially after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We compared the static and dynamic weightbearing kinematics of 10 female subjects after TKA. Using the same clinical scanner for both methods, static images were taken using our standard protocol, sequentialbiplane radiographs at multiple flexion angles, as well as with dynamic video fluoroscopy during a step up activity. The static method can reliably measure all 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) after TKA, however only seven were compared due to the poorer out-of-plane reliability in the single-plane dynamic imaging. No differences were found between the static and dynamic kinematics for nine out of ten subjects. For one subject, however, a difference of 5{\textendash}81 in internal/external tibial rotation was found. The research question, study purpose and the advantages and disadvantages of each method need to be considered when determining which imaging method to use.},

  abstract = {fMRI is the preeminent method for collecting signals from the human brain in vivo, for using these signals in the service of functional discovery, and relating these discoveries to anatomical structure. Numerous computational and mathematical techniques have been deployed to extract information from the fMRI signal. Yet, the application of Topological Data Analyses (TDA) remain limited to certain sub-areas such as connectomics (that is, with summarized versions of fMRI data). While connectomics is a natural and important area of application of TDA, applications of TDA in the service of extracting structure from the (non-summarized) fMRI data itself are heretofore nonexistent. "Structure" within fMRI data is determined by dynamic fluctuations in spatially distributed signals over time, and TDA is well positioned to help researchers better characterize mass dynamics of the signal by rigorously capturing shape within it. To accurately motivate this idea, we a) survey an established method in TDA ("persistent homology") to reveal and describe how complex structures can be extracted from data sets generally, and b) describe how persistent homology can be applied specifically to fMRI data. We provide explanations for some of the mathematical underpinnings of TDA (with expository figures), building ideas in the following sequence: a) fMRI researchers can and should use TDA to extract structure from their data; b) this extraction serves an important role in the endeavor of functional discovery, and c) TDA approaches can complement other established approaches toward fMRI analyses (for which we provide examples). We also provide detailed applications of TDA to fMRI data collected using established paradigms, and offer our software pipeline for readers interested in emulating our methods. This working overview is both an inter-disciplinary synthesis of ideas (to draw researchers in TDA and fMRI toward each other) and a detailed description of methods that can motivate collaborative research.},

Methods: Scapula SSM was built using 27 dry bone CT scans and augmented with three anatomical landmark sets (16 landmarks each) resulting in three augmented SSMs (aSSMproposed, aSSMset1, aSSMset2). The non-augmented and three augmented SSMs were then used in a non-rigid registration (regression) algorithm to fit to six external scapular shapes. The prediction error by each type of SSM was evaluated in the glenoid region for the goodness of fit (mean error, root mean square error, Hausdorff distance and Dice similarity coefficient) and for four anatomical angles (critical shoulder angle, lateral acromion angle, glenoid inclination, glenopoar angle). Results: Inter- and intra-observer reliability for landmark selection was moderate to excellent (ICC{$>$}0.74). Prediction error was significantly lower for SSMnon-augmented for mean (0.9mm) and root mean square (1.15mm) distances. Dice coefficient was significantly higher (0.78) for aSSMproposed compared to all other SSM types. Prediction error for anatomical angles was lowest using the aSSMproposed for critical shoulder angle (3.4{\textdegree}), glenoid inclination (2.6{\textdegree}), and lateral acromion angle (3.2{\textdegree}). Conclusion and Significance: The conventional SSM robustness criteria or better goodness of fit do not guarantee improved anatomical angle accuracy which may be crucial for certain clinical applications in pre-surgical planning. This study provides insights into how SSM augmented with region-specific anatomical landmarks can provide improved clinical relevance.},

  abstract = {Prediction of complete and premorbid scapular anatomy is an important aspect of successful shoulder arthroplasty surgeries to treat glenohumeral arthritis and which remains elusive in the current literature. We proposed to build a statistical shape model (SSM) of the scapula and use it to build a framework to predict a complete scapular shape from virtually created scapular bone defects. The bone defects were synthetically created to imitate bone loss in the glenoid region and missing bony part in inferior and superior scapular regions. Sixty seven dry scapulae were used to build the SSM while ten external scapular shapes (not used in SSM building) were selected to map scapular shape variability using its anatomical classification. For each external scapula, four virtual bone defects were created in the superior, inferior and glenoid regions by manually removing a part of the original mesh. Using these defective shapes as prior knowledge, original shapes were reconstructed using scapula SSM and Gaussian process regression. Robustness of the scapula SSM was excellent (generality = 0.79mm, specificity = 1.74mm, first 15 principal modes of variations accounted for 95\% variability). The validity and quality of the reconstruction of complete scapular bone were evaluated using two methods (1) mesh distances in terms of mean and RMS values and (2) four anatomical measures (three angles: glenoid version, glenoid inclination, and critical shoulder angle, and glenoid center location). The prediction error in the angle measures ranged from 1.0{\textdegree} to 2.2{\textdegree}. For mesh distances, highest mean and RMS error was 0.97mm and 1.30 respectively. DICE similarity coefficient between the original and predicted shapes was excellent ({$\geq$}0.81). This framework provided high reconstruction accuracy and can be effectively embedded in the pre-surgical planning of shoulder arthroplasty or in morphology-based shoulder biomechanics modeling pipelines.},

Augmented SSMs of scapula and humerus bones were built using bone meshes and five muscle attachment (origin/insertion) regions which play important role in the shoulder motion and function. Muscle attachments included Subscapularis, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Major and Teres Minor on both the bones. The regions were represented by subset of vertices on the bone meshes and were tracked using vertex identifiers. Subject-specific muscle attachment regions were predicted using external set of bones not used in building the SSMs. Validity of predictions was determined by visual inspection and also by using four similarity measures between predicted and manually segmented regions. Excellent concurrent validity was found indicating the higher accuracy of predictions. This method can be effectively employed in modeling pipelines or in automatic segmentation of medical images. Further validations are warranted on all the muscles of the shoulder complex.},

The availability of this quantitative information regarding the detailed anatomy of bones provides new opportunities for diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of skeletal diseases. The potential of SSM and SAM has been recently recognized within the bone research community. For example, these models have been applied for studying the effects of bone shape on the etiology of osteoarthritis, improving the accuracy of clinical osteoporotic fracture prediction techniques, design of orthopedic implants, and surgery planning. This paper reviews the main concepts, methods, and applications of SSM and SAM as applied to bone.},

This study accurately quantifies the relative movement between skin and the underlying bone, via X-ray flouroscopy and a mathematical model, in the interest of improving non-invasive knee movement analysis methods. It was found that skin-bone movement varies significantly over both medial and lateral femoral condyles (from 2 to 17 mm rms) and is, therefore, the greatest obstacle by far to obtaining accurate movement data non-intrusively. Data from the prclposed method is fundamental to improving acquisition methods for knee biomechanics and prosthetic analysis and can help in understanding soft tissue movement for orthotic analysis.},

Abnormal kinematics and incongruency of the articular surface may cause increased loads applied to the implant with concomitant polyethylene wear, resulting in loosening and implant failure. The purpose of this study was to measure three-dimensional kinematics of two-component total ankle arthroplasty during non-weightbearing and weightbearing activities, and to investigate incongruency of the articular surfaces during these activities. Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 71 years were enrolled. Radiographs were taken at non-weightbearing maximal dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and weightbearing maximal dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and neutral position. 3D{\textendash}2D model-image registration was performed using the radiographs and the three-dimensional implant models, and three-dimensional joint angles were determined. The implanted ankles showed 18.1{$\pm$}8.6{\textdegree} (mean{$\pm$}standard deviation) of plantarflexion, 0.1{$\pm$}0.7{\textdegree} of inversion, 1.2{$\pm$}2.0{\textdegree} of internal rotation, and 0.8{$\pm$}0.6mm of posterior translation of the talar component in the non-weightbearing activity, and 17.8{$\pm$}7.5{\textdegree} of plantarflexion, 0.4{$\pm$}0.5{\textdegree} of inversion, 1.8{$\pm$}2.0{\textdegree} of internal rotation, and 0.7{$\pm$}0.5mm of posterior translation in the weightbearing activity. There were no significant differences between the non-weightbearing and weightbearing kinematics except for the plantarflexion angle. Incongruency of the articular surface occurred in more than 75\% of the ankles. Our observations will provide useful data against which kinematics of other implant designs, such as three-component total ankle arthroplasty, can be compared.},

Tibial and femoral component alignment after TKA (varus-valgus, flexion-extension, and internal-external angulations) in 4 patients was determined directly with reconstructions from computed tomography (CT) scans and indirectly with the proposed bone and component image fitting techniques. Mean differences between alignment values from the CT and image fitting techniques ranged from 0.18{\textdegree} to 0.78{\textdegree}, and maximum differences ranged from 0.30{\textdegree} to 0.90{\textdegree}.

A mobile C-Arm fluoroscopy system (Ziehm Vision R) and a CCD camera were used for the measurement of a patient's knee kinematics. The fluoroscopic images were recorded with 12 fps and then sent to Matlab software (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for image processing. In parallel, CT scan images of the knee bones were used to create the 3D anatomical geometry of the knee by aid of Mimics software (Materialise NV). However, the geometrical model of the two medial and lateral menisci was generated from MRI data. The 3D geometrical model of the knee was then sent to Abaqus finite element software (Simulia Dassault Systems) to analyse the knee joint contact loads by introducing the boundary condition which was obtained from fluoroscopic images. The finite element model was used to evaluate the stress distribution on the cartilages during the gait. The result was then compared with the experimental data of gait analysis. The comparison between the results showed a close agreement between the two outcomes.},

Human observers are sensitive to the 2D rotational-symmetry of a retinal image, but they are less sensitive than they are to 2D mirror-symmetry, which involves invariance to reflection across an axis. Note that perception of the mirror-symmetry of a 2D image and a 3D shape has been well studied, where it has been shown that observers are sensitive to the mirror-symmetry of a 3D shape, and that 3D mirror-symmetry plays a critical role in the veridical perception of a 3D shape from its 2D image. On the other hand, the perception of rotational-symmetry, especially 3D rotational-symmetry, has received very little study. In this paper, we derive the geometrical properties of 2D and 3D rotational-symmetry and compare them to the geometrical properties of mirror-symmetry. Then, we discuss perceptual differences between mirror- and rotational-symmetry based on this comparison. We found that rotational-symmetry has many geometrical properties that are similar to the geometrical properties of mirror-symmetry, but note that the 2D projection of a 3D rotational-symmetrical shape is more complex computationally than the 2D projection of a 3D mirror-symmetrical shape. This computational difficulty could make the human visual system less sensitive to the rotational-symmetry of a 3D shape than its mirror-symmetry.},

Method: A systematic review extracted quantitative observational, quasi-experimental and experimental studies from PubMed, Scopus, Medline and Web of Science that examined motion of the bony or articular surfaces of the tibiofemoral joint during any functional activity. Studies using surface markers, animals, and in vitro studies were excluded. Results: 352 studies were screened to include 23 studies. Dynamic kinematics were recorded for gait, step-up, kneeling, squat and lunge and quasi-static squat, knee flexion in side-lying or supine legpress. Kinematics were described using a diverse range of measures including six degrees of freedom kinematics, contact patterns or the projection of the femoral condylar axis above the tibia. Metaanalysis of data was not possible since no three papers recorded the same activity with the same measures. Visual evaluation of data revealed that knees with osteoarthritis maintained a more adducted position and showed less posterior translation of the lateral femoral condylar axis than healthy knees. Variability in activities and in recording measures produced greater variation in kinematics, than did knee osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Differences in kinematics between osteoarthritic and healthy knees were observed, however, these differences were more subtle than expected. The synthesis and progress of this research could be facilitated by a consensus on reference systems for axes and kinematic reporting.},

  abstract = {Objectives Throughout the 20th Century, it has been postulated that the knee moves on the basis of a four-bar link mechanism composed of the cruciate ligaments, the femur and the tibia. As a consequence, the femur has been thought to roll back with flexion, and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) prostheses have been designed on this basis. Recent work, however, has proposed that at a position of between 0{\textdegree} and 120{\textdegree} the medial femoral condyle does not move anteroposteriorly whereas the lateral femoral condyle tends, but is not obliged, to roll back {\textendash} a combination of movements which equates to tibial internal/ femoral external rotation with flexion. The aim of this paper was to assess if the articular geometry of the GMK Sphere TKA could recreate the natural knee movements in situ/ in vivo. Methods The pattern of knee movement was studied in 15 patients (six male: nine female; one male with bilateral TKAs) with 16 GMK Sphere implants, at a mean age of 66 years (53 to 76) with a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2 (20 to 35). The motions of all 16 knees were observed using pulsed fluoroscopy during a number of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing static and dynamic activities. Results During maximally flexed kneeling and lunging activities, the mean tibial internal rotation was 8{\textdegree} (standard deviation (sd) 6). At a mean 112{\textdegree} flexion (sd 16) during lunging, the medial and lateral condyles were a mean of 2 mm (sd 3) and 8 mm (sd 4) posterior to a transverse line passing through the centre of the medial tibial concavity. With a mean flexion of 117{\textdegree} (sd 14) during kneeling, the medial and lateral condyles were a mean of 1 mm (sd 4) anterior and 6 mm (sd 4) posterior to the same line. During dynamic stair and pivoting activities, there was a mean anteroposterior translation of 0 mm to 2 mm of the medial femoral condyle. Backward lateral condylar translation occurred and was linearly related to tibial rotation. Conclusion The GMK Sphere TKA in our study group shows movements similar in pattern, although reduced in magnitude, to those in recent reports relating to normal knees during several activities. Specifically, little or no translation of the medial femoral condyle was observed during flexion, but there was posterior roll-back of the lateral femoral condyle, equating to tibiofemoral rotation. We conclude that the GMK Sphere is anteroposteriorly stable medially and permits rotation about the medial compartment.},

  abstract = {Abstract  We have previously described the application of an automated microculture tetrazolium assay (MTA) involving dimethyl sulfoxide solubilization of cellular-generated 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-formazan to the in vitro assessment of drug effects on cell growth (M. C. Alley et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 27:389, 1986; M. C. Alley et al., Cancer Res. 48: 589{\textendash}601, 1988). There are several inherent disadvantages of this assay, including the safety hazard of personnel exposure to large quantities of dimethyl sulfoxide, the deleterious effects of this solvent on laboratory equipment, and the inefficient metabolism of MTT by some human cell lines. Recognition of these limitations prompted development of possible alternative MTAs utilizing a different tetrazolium reagent, 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT), which is metabolically reduced in viable cells to a water-soluble formazan product. This reagent allows direct absorbance readings, therefore eliminating a solubilization step and shortening the microculture growth assay procedure. Most human tumor cell lines examined metabolized XTT less efficiently than MTT; however, the addition of phenazine methosulfate (PMS) markedly enhanced cellular reduction of XTT. In the presence of PMS, the XTT reagent yielded usable absorbance values for growth and drug sensitivity evaluations with a variety of cell lines. Depending on the metabolic reductive capacity of a given cell line, the optimal conditions for a 4-h XTT incubation assay were 50 {\textmu}g of XTT and 0.15 to 0.4 {\textmu}g of PMS per well. Drug profiles obtained with representative human tumor cell lines for several standard compounds utilizing the XTT-PMS methodology were similar to the profiles obtained with MTT. Addition of PMS appeared to have little effect on the metabolism of MTT. The new XTT reagent thus provides for a simplified, in vitro cell growth assay with possible applicability to a variety of problems in cellular pharmacology and biology. However, the MTA using the XTT reagent still shares many of the limitations and potential pitfalls of MTT or other tetrazolium-based assays.},

They have been shown to be beneficial for stabilizing therapeutic compounds, overcoming obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake, and improving biodistribution of compounds to target sites in vivo. This enables effective delivery of encapsulated compounds to target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Liposomes present as an attractive delivery system due to their flexible physicochemical and biophysical properties, which allow easy manipulation to address different delivery considerations. Despite considerable research in the last 50 years and the plethora of positive results in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of liposome assisted drug delivery platforms has progressed incrementally. In this review, we will discuss the advances in liposome assisted drug delivery, biological challenges that still remain, and current clinical and experimental use of liposomes for biomedical applications. The translational obstacles of liposomal technology will also be presented.},

  abstract = {Through wearable sensors and deep learning techniques, biomechanical analysis can reach beyond the lab for clinical and sporting applications. Transformers, a class of recent deep learning models, have become widely used in state-of-the-art artificial intelligence research due to their superior performance in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The performance of transformer models has not yet been investigated in biomechanics applications. In this study, we introduce a Biomechanical Multi-activity Transformer-based model, BioMAT, for the estimation of joint kinematics from streaming signals of multiple inertia measurement units (IMUs) using a publicly available dataset. This dataset includes IMU signals and the corresponding sagittal plane kinematics of the hip, knee, and ankle joints during multiple activities of daily living. We evaluated the model's performance and generalizability and compared it against a convolutional neural network long short-term model, a bidirectional long short-term model, and multi-linear regression across different ambulation tasks including level ground walking (LW), ramp ascent (RA), ramp descent (RD), stair ascent (SA), and stair descent (SD). To investigate the effect of different activity datasets on prediction accuracy, we compared the performance of a universal model trained on all activities against task-specific models trained on individual tasks. When the models were tested on three unseen subjects' data, BioMAT outperformed the benchmark models with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.5 {$\pm$} 0.5◦, and normalized RMSE of 6.8 {$\pm$} 0.3◦ across all three joints and all activities. A unified BioMAT model demonstrated superior performance compared to individual task-specific models across four of five activities. The RMSE values from the universal model for LW, RA, RD, SA, and SD activities were 5.0 {$\pm$} 1.5◦, 6.2 {$\pm$} 1.1◦, 5.8 {$\pm$} 1.1◦, 5.3 {$\pm$} 1.6◦, and 5.2 {$\pm$} 0.7◦ while these values for task-specific models were, 5.3 {$\pm$} 2.1◦, 6.7 {$\pm$} 2.0◦, 6.9 {$\pm$} 2.2◦, 4.9 {$\pm$} 1.4◦, and 5.6 {$\pm$} 1.3◦, respectively. Overall, BioMAT accurately estimated joint kinematics relative to previous machine learning algorithms across different activities directly from the sequence of IMUs signals instead of time-normalized gait cycle data.},

  abstract = {The patellar tendon moment arm is a critical quantity in that it defines the quadriceps ability to generate a moment on the tibia. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to establish the first in vivo three-dimensional measures of the patellar tendon moment arm, measured non-invasively and in vivo during dynamic activity in a large normative population (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 34) using a dynamic MRI technique (fast-PC MRI). The magnitude of the moment arm was defined as the shortest distance between the finite helical axis and the patellar tendon line of action. Using these data, the hypothesis that the patellar tendon moment arm is independent of gender was tested. In general, the moment arm increased from 20 to 50 mm during knee extension. There were significant differences (Po0.05) in the moment arm between gender, but these differences were eliminated when the moment arm was scaled by the femoral epicondylar width. This study took a large step forward towards the ultimate goal of defining how pathology may alter joint dynamics through alteration in moment arms by establishing the first in vivo normative data base for the patellar tendon moment arm using non-invasive measures during volitional activity in a relatively large population (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 34). The fact that the scaled moment arm was independent of gender may lend insights into impairments that tend to be gender specific, such as patellar maltracking. The next steps will be to quantify the patellar tendon moment arm in populations with specific pathologies.},

For automated and accurate diagnosis of RCT, we propose a full 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) based method using deep learning. This 3D CNN automatically diagnoses the presence or absence of an RCT, classifies the tear size, and provides 3D visualization of the tear location. To train the 3D CNN, the Voxception-ResNet (VRN) structure was used. This architecture uses 3D convolution filters, so it is advantageous in extracting information from 3D data compared with 2D-based CNNs or traditional diagnosis methods. MRI data from 2,124 patients were used to train and test the VRN-based 3D CNN. The network is trained to classify RCT into five classes (None, Partial, Small, Medium, Large-to-Massive). A 3D class activation map (CAM) was visualized by volume rendering to show the localization and size information of RCT in 3D. A comparative experiment was performed for the proposed method and clinical experts by using randomly selected 200 test set data, which had been separated from training set. The VRN-based 3D CNN outperformed orthopedists specialized in shoulder and general orthopedists in binary accuracy (92.5\% vs. 76.4\% and 68.2\%), top-1 accuracy (69.0\% vs. 45.8\% and 30.5\%), top-1{$\pm$}1 accuracy (87.5\% vs. 79.8\% and 71.0\%), sensitivity (0.94 vs. 0.86 and 0.90), and specificity (0.90 vs. 0.58 and 0.29). The generated 3D CAM provided effective information regarding the 3D location and size of the tear. Given these results, the proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of artificial intelligence that can assist in clinical RCT diagnosis.},

A further goal of this paper is to present a method for extracting the curvature scale space (CSS) on the same SIMD processor. For contour extraction, the detected contour points are first stored as they are detected, and then effectively reordered with low memory overhead. For extracting the CSS, we introduce a high-precision Gaussian filtering scheme using an extended number representation that is particularly suited for the SIMD processor of the camera. We demonstrate both in real time.},

  abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography(CT) data in various applications in radiation therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize CT data in heterogeneous dose calculation algorithms. In radiotherapyimaging applications, CT data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing ``radiographs,'' which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the CT array. Due to the complexity of the three-dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of CT data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the CT data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the CT data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three-dimensional CT array of N 3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N 3, the number of voxels. Coded in fortran-77 on a VAX 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 1003 voxel array.},

However, it is a challenging task due to the complex intensity relationships between different imaging modalities, which can result in large discrepancy in image appearance.

Particularly, deep learning registration algorithms lack in accuracy or even fail completely when attempting to register data from an ''unseen'' modality. In this work, we present Modality Agnostic Distance (MAD), a deep image distance measure that utilises random convolutions to learn the inherent geometry of the images while being robust to large appearance changes. Random convolutions are geometry-preserving modules which we use to simulate an infinite number of synthetic modalities alleviating the need for aligned paired data during training. We can therefore train MAD on a mono-modal dataset and successfully apply it to a multi-modal dataset. We demonstrate that not only can MAD affinely register multi-modal images successfully, but it has also a larger capture range than traditional measures such as Mutual Information and Normalised Gradient Fields. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ModalityAgnosticDistance/MAD.},

  abstract = {This article shows how John Maynard Keynes's lifelong commitment to eugenics was deeply embedded in his political, economic, and philosophical work. At the turn of the century, eugenics seemed poised to grant industrial nations unprecedented control over their own future, but that potential depended on contested understandings of the biological mechanisms of inheritance. Early in his career, Keynes helped William Bateson, Britain's chief proponent of Mendelian genetics, analyze problems in human heredity. Simultaneously, Keynes publicly opposed the efforts by Francis Galton and Karl Pearson to study inheritance through statistical biometry. For Keynes, this conflict was morally laden: Mendelism incorporated the only ethical theory of uncertainty, while biometry rested on false and dangerous concepts. This early study of heredity shaped Keynes's visions of industrial democracy after 1918. Liberals looked for a system of societal and economic management to engineer an escape from the postwar Malthusian trap. Britain's economic plight, Keynes argued, was rooted in the hereditary weaknesses of its leadership. Successful technocratic liberalism would depend on control over the quality as well as quantity of human beings. Ultimately, in his essay ``Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,'' Keynes predicted that effective eugenic management would bring about capitalism's end.},

We also investigate (1) how the utility of stacking changes when one of the models being combined is the model that generated the data, (2) how the stacking coefficients of the models compare to the relative frequencies with which cross-validation chooses among the models, (3) visualization of combined ``effective'' kernels, and (4) the sensitivity of stacking to overfitting as model complexity increases.},

In this SRV representation, the elastic metric simplifies to the IL2 metric, the reparameterization group acts by isometries, and the space of unit length curves becomes the unit sphere. The shape space of closed curves is the quotient space of (a submanifold of) the unit sphere, modulo rotation, and reparameterization groups, and we find geodesics in that space using a path straightening approach. These geodesics and geodesic distances provide a framework for optimally matching, deforming, and comparing shapes. These ideas are demonstrated using: 1) shape analysis of cylindrical helices for studying protein structure, 2) shape analysis of facial curves for recognizing faces, 3) a wrapped probability distribution for capturing shapes of planar closed curves, and 4) parallel transport of deformations for predicting shapes from novel poses.},

The alignment of the quadriceps muscle and patella suggests that the patella should deviate laterally out of the patellar groove as the quadriceps muscle contracts during walking. The surgical treatment of patellar subluxation has been based on this presumption. The purpose of this study was to determine the movements of the patella in relation to the other bones of the knee joint during normal walking. This is the first study we know of that uses radiographs to show these movements. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eight healthy adult volunteers with no previous cornplaints referable to the knee walked on a slowly moving treadmill while their patellae were imaged fluoroscopically in the anteroposterior plane with a Toshiba C-arm. Images were retrieved, transferred to radiographic film, and randomized to prevent the observers from knowing the order of images. The position of the patella was measured and plotted in relation to fixed points of the knee. RESULTS. In each of the subjects at every gait cycle, the patella was observed to move vertically first, followed by a sudden shift to the medial side before returning to its original position. CONCLUSION. Contrary to conventional understanding, our results show that the patella deviates medially rather than laterally during walking. This occurs because of differential contraction},

This paper presents a study covering an extensive examination of various candidate selection and partitioning techniques within the same DIRECT algorithmic framework. Twelve DIRECT-type algorithmic variations are compared on 800 randomly generated GKLS-type test problems and 96 box-constrained global optimization problems from DIRECTGOLib v1.1 with varying complexity.

  abstract = {Background: It is often assumed that body posture, standing vs. supine, changes shoulder muscle activation and range of motion, but these altered shoulder mechanics have not been objectively assessed. We expected the supine posture might facilitate scapular rotation and change subacromial pressure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of body posture on shoulder kinematics during arm elevation. Methods: Ten males and eight females with a mean age of 33 years participated in this study. Shoulder kinematics were assessed during scapular plane elevation in the standing and supine postures by using single-plane fluoroscopic images. Kinematics were measured using 3-dimensional to 2-dimensional model-image registration techniques: matching the 3-dimensional bone model derived from computed tomography onto each fluoroscopic image. Glenohumeral superior/inferior translation, acromiohumeral distance, and scapular rotations were compared between the postures. The effect of sex also was evaluated. Results: With the arm at the side position, the humeral head in the supine posture was located 0.5 mm superior compared to the standing posture (P {$<$} .001). During humeral elevation, the humeral head significantly shifted more inferiorly in the supine posture than in standing; the biggest mean difference was 0.6 mm, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .003. But acromiohumeral distance during elevation was not significantly affected by the body posture (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .05). Scapular upward rotation and posterior tilt were significantly different between the postures (P {$<$} .001). Sex had statistically significant, but quantitatively small, effects on shoulder kinematics. Conclusions: Body postures affect shoulder kinematics during humeral elevation. This knowledge will be useful to optimize rehabilitation exercises and for diagnostic insight. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {This paper presents a moving horizon estimator (MHE) for estimating pose (attitude and position) of a dynamic system where pose measurements are available in the form of unit dual quaternions. A unit dual quaternion is an 8 parameter nonsingular representation of pose and has previously been used for pose estimation with Kalman filters (KF). We formulate a cost function in terms of the quaternion product and propose a MHE that includes the N latest measurements in the estimation. In addition, we suggest a measurement relation based on the Cayley transform of the noise, where the noise has a Gaussian distribution about the x-y-z and roll-pitch-yaw parameters of the pose. The MHE is compared against the dual quaternion multiplicative extended KF (DQ-MEKF) and the twistor-based unscented KF (T-UKF) through 100 Monte Carlo simulations, where the simulated data is generated according to the defined system dynamics. It is found that the MHE gives more accurate pose estimation results.},

We present a complete toolkit for the automated extraction of chemical entities and their associated properties, measurements, and relationships from scientific documents that can be used to populate structured chemical databases. Our system provides an extensible, chemistry-aware, natural language processing pipeline for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and phrase parsing.

One hundred three shoulder CT scans from 95 patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis undergoing anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty were retrospectively retrieved. Three independent radiologists manually segmented the premorbid boundaries of all four RC muscles on standardized sagittal-oblique CT sections. This premorbid muscle segmentation was further automatically predicted using a CNN. Automatically predicted premorbid segmentations were then used to quantify the ratio of muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, secondary bone formation, and overall muscle degeneration. These muscle parameters were compared with measures obtained manually by human raters. Average Dice similarity coefficients for muscle segmentations obtained automatically with the CNN (88\%{$\pm$}9\%) and manually by human raters (89\%{$\pm$}6\%) were comparable. No significant differences were observed for the subscapularis, supraspinatus, and teres minor muscles (p{$>$}0.120), whereas Dice coefficients of the automatic segmentation were significantly higher for the infraspinatus (p{$<$}0.012). The automatic approach was able to provide good{\textendash}very good estimates of muscle atrophy (R2=0.87), fatty infiltration (R2=0.91), and overall muscle degeneration (R2=0.91). However, CNN-derived segmentations showed a higher variability in quantifying secondary bone formation (R2=0.61) than human raters (R2=0.87).

Especially when very large point sets are compared using the HD, for example when evaluating magnetic resonance volume segmentations, or when the underlying applications are based on time critical tasks, like motion detection, then the computational complexity of HD algorithms becomes an important issue. In this paper we propose a novel efficient algorithm for computing the exact Hausdorff distance. In a runtime analysis, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to have nearly-linear complexity. Furthermore, it has efficient performance for large point set sizes as well as for large grid size; performs equally for sparse and dense point sets; and finally it is general without restrictions on the characteristics of the point set. The proposed algorithm is tested against the HD algorithm of the widely used national library of medicine insight segmentation and registration toolkit (ITK) using magnetic resonance volumes with extremely large size. The proposed algorithm outperforms the ITK HD algorithm both in speed and memory required. In an experiment using trajectories from a road network, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms an HD algorithm based on R-Trees.},

Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics. Result: First we present an overview of 20 evaluation metrics selected based on a comprehensive literature review. For fuzzy segmentation, which shows the level of membership of each voxel to multiple classes, fuzzy definitions of all metrics are provided. We present a discussion about metric properties to provide a guide for selecting evaluation metrics. Finally, we propose an efficient evaluation tool implementing the 20 selected metrics. The tool is optimized to perform efficiently in terms of speed and required memory, also if the image size is extremely large as in the case of whole body MRI or CT volume segmentation. An implementation of this tool is available as an open source project. Conclusion: We propose an efficient evaluation tool for 3D medical image segmentation using 20 evaluation metrics and provide guidelines for selecting a subset of these metrics that is suitable for the data and the segmentation task.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly malignant brain tumor. For personalized treatment, an accurate pre-operative prognosis for GBM patients is highly desired. Recently, many machine learning-based methods have been adopted to predict overall survival (OS) time based on the pre-operative mono- or multi-modal imaging phenotype. The genotypic information of GBM has been proven to be strongly indicative of the prognosis; however, this has not been considered in the existing imaging-based OS prediction methods. The main reason is that the tumor genotype is unavailable pre-operatively unless deriving from craniotomy. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based OS prediction method for GBM patients, which can derive tumor genotype-related features from pre-operative multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain data and feed them to OS prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to accomplish both tumor genotype and OS prediction tasks jointly. As the network can benefit from learning tumor genotype-related features for genotype prediction, the accuracy of predicting OS time can be prominently improved. In the experiments, multimodal MRI brain dataset of 120 GBM patients, with as many as four different genotypic/molecular biomarkers, are used to evaluate our method. Our method achieves the highest OS prediction accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

For each frame of the fluoroscopy data, the relative location of the femoral and tibial components were determined, and the apparent intersection of the femoral component with the tibial insert was used to calculate wear volume, wear depth, and frequency of intersection. No difference was found between the measured and true wear volumes. The precision of the measurements was {$\pm$}39.7 mm3 for volume and {$\pm$}0.126 mm for wear depth.

Rehabilitation to improve strength and muscle activation seems imperative to restore proper muscle firing patterns early after surgery.},

Proper validation of such estimates, however, has not been performed under loading conditions approximating functional tasks, such as gait, squatting, and stair descent. The goal of this study was to perform an in vitro validation to resolve the accuracy of cartilage contact estimations in comparison to a laser scanning gold standard. Results demonstrated acceptable reliability and accuracy for both contact area and centroid location estimates. Root mean square errors in contact area averaged 8.4\% and 4.4\% of the medial and lateral compartmental areas, respectively. Modified Sorensen-Dice agreement scores of contact regions averaged 0.81 {$\pm$} 0.07 for medial and 0.83 {$\pm$} 0.07 for lateral compartments. These validated methods have applications for in vivo assessment of a variety of patient populations and physical activities, and may lead to greater understanding of the relationships between knee cartilage function, effects of joint injury and treatment, and the development of osteoarthritis.},

We review results from the literature, which show that if the predictor variables are drawn from a continuous probability distribution, then there is a unique lasso solution with probability one, regardless of the sizes of n and p. We also show that this result extends easily to 1 penalized minimization problems over a wide range of loss functions.},

The second part is concerned with topological embedding methods, in particular mapping topological properties into persistence diagrams. Another type of data sets with a tremendous growth is very high-dimensional network data. The task considered in part three is how to embed such data in a vector space of moderate dimension to make the data amenable to traditional techniques such as cluster and classification techniques. The final part of the survey deals with embedding in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\^2\$, which is visualization. Three methods are presented: \$t\$-SNE, UMAP and LargeVis based on methods in parts one, two and three, respectively. The methods are illustrated and compared on two simulated data sets; one consisting of a triple of noisy Ranunculoid curves, and one consisting of networks of increasing complexity and with two types of nodes.},

One such group of nutrients are the n-3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3). Results from studies where human, animal and cellular models have been utilised to investigate the effects of EPA and/or DHA on white adipose tissue/adipocytes suggest anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects. We review here evidence for these effects, specifically focusing on studies that provide some insight into metabolic pathways or processes. Of note, limited work has been undertaken investigating the effects of EPA and DHA on white adipose tissue in humans whilst more work has been undertaken using animal and cellular models. Taken together it would appear that EPA and DHA have a positive effect on lowering lipogenesis, increasing lipolysis and decreasing inflammation, all of which would be beneficial for adipose tissue biology. What remains to be elucidated is the duration and dose required to see a favourable effect of EPA and DHA in vivo in humans, across a range of adiposity.},

Also, in contrast with standardjltering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image.},

This work presents optimized DRR rendering on graphical processor units (GPUs) and compares performance achievable on four commercially available devices. Methods : A ray-cast based DRR rendering was implemented for a 512 {\texttimes} 512 {\texttimes} 72 CT volume. The block size parameter was optimized for four different GPUs for a region of interest (ROI) of 400 {\texttimes} 225 pixels with different sampling ratios (1.1\%{\textendash}9.1\% and 100\%). Performance was statistically evaluated and compared for the four GPUs. The method and the block size dependence were validated on the latest GPU for several parameter settings with a public gold standard dataset (512 {\texttimes} 512 {\texttimes} 825 CT) for registration purposes. Results : Depending on the GPU, the full ROI is rendered in 2.7{\textendash}5.2 ms. If sampling ratio of 1.1\%{\textendash}9.1\% is applied, execution time is in the range of 0.3{\textendash}7.3 ms. On all GPUs, the mean of the execution time increased linearly with respect to the number of pixels if sampling was used. Conclusions : The presented results outperform other results from the literature. This indicates that automatic 2D to 3D registration, which typically requires a couple of hundred DRR renderings to converge, can be performed quasi on-line, in less than a second or depending on the application and hardware in less than a couple of seconds. Accordingly, a whole new field of applications is opened for image guided interventions, where the registration is continuously performed to match the real-time x-ray.},

This review examines most critical QSAR modeling routines that we regard as best practices in the field. We discuss these procedures in the context of integrative predictive QSAR modeling workflow that is focused on achieving models of the highest statistical rigor and external predictive power. Specific elements of the workflow consist of data preparation including chemical structure (and when possible, associated biological data) curation, outlier detection, dataset balancing, and model validation. We especially emphasize procedures used to validate models, both internally and externally, as well as the need to define model applicability domains that should be used when models are employed for the prediction of external compounds or compound libraries. Finally, we present several examples of successful applications of QSAR models for virtual screening to identify experimentally confirmed hits.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Accurate measurement of the three-dimensional ͑3D͒ rigid body and surface kinematics of the natural human knee is essential for many clinical applications. Existing techniques are limited either in their accuracy or lack more realistic experimental evaluation of the measurement errors. The purposes of the study were to develop a volumetric model-based 2D to 3D registration method, called the weighted edge-matching score ͑WEMS͒ method, for measuring natural knee kinematics with single-plane fluoroscopy to determine experimentally the measurement errors and to compare its performance with that of pattern intensity ͑PI͒ and gradient difference ͑GD͒ methods. Methods: The WEMS method gives higher priority to matching of longer edges of the digitally reconstructed radiograph and fluoroscopic images. The measurement errors of the methods were evaluated based on a human cadaveric knee at 11 flexion positions. Results: The accuracy of the WEMS method was determined experimentally to be less than 0.77 mm for the in-plane translations, 3.06 mm for out-of-plane translation, and 1.13{\textdegree} for all rotations, which is better than that of the PI and GD methods. Conclusions: A new volumetric model-based 2D to 3D registration method has been developed for measuring 3D in vivo kinematics of natural knee joints with single-plane fluoroscopy. With the equipment used in the current study, the accuracy of the WEMS method is considered acceptable for the measurement of the 3D kinematics of the natural knee in clinical applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. ͓DOI: 10.1118/1.3301596͔},

However, there are few reviews which have described clear retear rates for each repaired tendon classified according to preoperative Goutallier stage. The purpose of this study was therefore to systematically review the literature on the relationship between preoperative Goutallier stage and retear rates and provide predictable retear rates following primary repair of posterosuperior rotator cuff tears.A systematic literature review was performed in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines and checklist utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library. English-language studies of Level I through IV evidence examining the clinical results of primarily repaired posterosuperior rotator cuff tears as a function of Goutallier stage using MRI were included. The primary outcome of interest was retear rates according to preoperative Goutallier stage. As a secondary outcome, rotator cuff tears were divided into two subgroups (Goutallier stage 0-2 and 3-4) and retear rates were assessed between the two subgroups. A random effects model with binomial within-study variance was used for both outcomes.Nine studies (687 shoulders) satisfied all inclusion criteria and reported sufficient data for statistical analysis. In the supraspinatus muscle group, rotator cuff muscles with preoperative Goutallier stages of 0, 1 and 2 had retear rates of 19.1\%, 27.8\% and 33.5\%, respectively with no significant differences between each category. In contrast, when preoperative Goutallier stage of 3 and 4 existed, significant differences compared to Goutallier 0, 1 and 2 were observed with a retear rate of 74.1\% and 78.5\%, respectively. In the infraspinatus muscle group, the retear rates following rotator cuff repairs were 20.0\%, 32.1\% and 35.1\% in Goutallier 0, 1 and 2, respectively, with no significant differences between each category. In Goutallier 3 and 4, the rate was 76.6\% and 100.0\%, respectively, with significant differences compared to Goutallier 0, 1 and 2.The results of this study have clearly demonstrated that retear rates following surgical repair of the rotator cuff increased in proportion to the preoperative Goutallier stage in both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.},

  abstract = {We have studied various factors involved in the optimal use of a tetrazolium (MTT) based colorimetric assay for cell growth and chemosensitivity. The assay is dependent on the ability of viable cells to metabolise a water-soluble tetrazolium salt into a water-insoluble formazan product. We have found that DMSO is the best solvent for dissolving the formazan product, especially where a significant amount of residual medium is left in the wells of the microtitre tray used for the assay. A reaction occurs between medium and a solution of MTT formazan in DMSO which changes the shape of the absorbance spectrum of the solution. The resulting optical density is not however greatly dependent upon the volume of added medium in the range 1-10 microliters. Between 10 and 40 microliters of added medium results in a gradually lower optical density than that produced by the smaller volumes. Above 40 microliters, the optical density increases again due to turbidity as protein precipitation occurs. When cells are incubated with MTT, the resulting optical density of the formazan product is dependent upon both the concentration of MTT and the incubation time. The optical density is stable for several hours after solution of the formazan in DMSO. A linear relationship is seen between optical density and cell number for incubation times of 2, 4, 6 or 24 h with 20 microliters of MTT (5 mg ml-1) added to 200 microliters medium. We have adopted 4 h as the standard incubation time for the assay. Only a small amount of MTT formazan product can be detected in the growth medium of wells in which cells have been exposed to MTT. Comparative chemosensitivity data for EMT6 mouse tumour cells show good agreement between results obtained using the MTT assay and results based on total cell count after a fixed period of growth.},

  abstract = {Obesity affects more than 10\% of the adult population globally. Despite the introduction of diverse medications aimed at combating fat accumulation and obesity, a significant number of these pharmaceutical interventions are linked to substantial occurrences of severe adverse events, occasionally leading to their withdrawal from the market. Natural products serve as attractive sources for anti-obesity agents as many of them can alter the host metabolic processes and maintain glucose homeostasis via metabolic and thermogenic stimulation, appetite regulation, pancreatic lipase and amylase inhibition, insulin sensitivity enhancing, adipogenesis inhibition and adipocyte apoptosis induction. In this review, we shed light on the biological processes that control energy balance and thermogenesis as well as metabolic pathways in white adipose tissue browning, we also highlight the anti-obesity potential of natural products with their mechanism of action. Based on previous findings, the crucial proteins and molecular pathways involved in adipose tissue browning and lipolysis induction are uncoupling protein-1, PR domain containing 16, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{$\gamma$} in addition to Sirtuin-1 and AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. Given that some phytochemicals can also lower proinflammatory substances like TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-6, and IL-1 secreted from adipose tissue and change the production of adipokines like leptin and adiponectin, which are important regulators of body weight, natural products represent a treasure trove for anti-obesity agents. In conclusion, conducting comprehensive research on natural products holds the potential to accelerate the development of an improved obesity management strategy characterized by heightened efficacy and reduced incidence of side effects.},

  abstract = {Early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in effectively treating numerous diseases, especially in healthcare scenarios where prompt and accurate diagnoses are essential. Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for medical tasks, offering advantages over traditional supervised learning methods. However, in healthcare, patient metadata contains valuable clinical information that can enhance representations, yet existing CL methods often overlook this data. In this study, we propose an novel approach that leverages both clinical information and imaging data in contrastive learning to enhance model generalization and interpretability. Furthermore, existing contrastive methods may be prone to sampling bias, which can lead to the model capturing spurious relationships and exhibiting unequal performance across protected subgroups frequently encountered in medical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce Patient-aware Contrastive Learning (PaCL), featuring an inter-class separability objective (IeSO) and an intra-class diversity objective (IaDO). IeSO harnesses rich clinical information to refine samples, while IaDO ensures the necessary diversity among samples to prevent class collapse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PaCL both theoretically through causal refinements and empirically across six real-world medical imaging tasks spanning three imaging modalities: ophthalmology, radiology, and dermatology. Notably, PaCL outperforms previous techniques across all six tasks.},

This study presents a simultaneous in vivo measurement of tibiofemoral articular contact forces and contact kinematics in three TKA patients. These measurements were accomplished via a dual fluoroscopic imaging system and instrumented tibial implants, during dynamic single leg lunge and chair rising{\textendash}sitting. The measured forces and contact locations were also used to determine mediolateral distribution of axial contact forces. Contact kinematics data showed a medial pivot during flexion of the knee, for all patients in the study. Average axial forces were higher for lunge compared to chair rising{\textendash}sitting (224\% vs. 187\% body weight). In this study, we measured peak anteroposterior and mediolateral forces averaging 13.3\% BW during lunge and 18.5\% BW during chair rising{\textendash}sitting. Mediolateral distributions of axial contact force were both patient and activity specific. All patients showed equitable medial{\textendash}lateral loading during lunge but greater loads at the lateral compartment during chair rising{\textendash}sitting. The results of this study may enable more accurate reproduction of in vivo loads and articular motion patterns in wear simulators and finite element models. This in turn may help advance our understanding of factors limiting longevity of TKA implants, such as aseptic loosening and polyethylene component wear, and enable improved TKA designs.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The digital analysis procedure consisted of the following steps: (1) the detection of markers using a variant of the Hough circle-finder technique; (2) the identification and labeling of the detected markers; (3) the reconstruction of the three-dimensional position of the bone markers and the prosthetic markers; and (4) the computation of micromotion.},

Rotator cuff reconstruction is more likely to result in retear if the muscle has atrophy or fatty degeneration. Thus, atrophy and fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle are predictors of the postoperative course, and volume analysis using three-dimensional segmentation of the supraspinatus muscle is necessary. The supraspinatus muscle is attached to the scapula, making it possible to estimate the region of the muscle based on the position of the scapula. In this paper, we propose a supraspinatus muscle segmentation method based on the scapula position in torso computed tomography (CT) images. Our proposed method consists of supraspinatus muscle localization using a scapula segmentation result and supraspinatus muscle segmentation based on the localization result. U-Net is used for scapula and supraspinatus muscle segmentation. In this experiment, we used torso CT images and pseudo-chest CT images which were generated from the scans of the same patient. The mean Dice values of the segmentation results obtained by applying the proposed method to the torso and pseudo-chest CT images were both 0.881. When localization was not used, the mean Dice values of the segmentation results in the torso and pseudo-chest CT images were 0.000 and 0.850, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of bone-based localization in supraspinatus muscle segmentation using U-Net.},

Our method of threedimensional shape analysis using normalized Fourier descriptors is in\- formation preserving, yet is as fast as previous suboptimum methods. In addition, our feature vector has a linear property, allowing us to interpolate between library projections and effectively define a con\- tinuum of library projections rather than a finite set. This method is applied to the analysis of sequential data varying in resolution and orientation relative to the camera. Computational considerations are discussed, and it is seen that real-time implementation of the method is feasible.},

Due to its widespread applications in a great variety of areas, such as human motion analysis, human{\textendash}computer interaction, robots, 3D human pose estimation has recently attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community, however, it is a challenging task due to depth ambiguities and the lack of in-the-wild datasets. A large number of approaches, with many based on deep learning, have been developed over the past decade, largely advancing the performance on existing benchmarks. To guide future development, a comprehensive literature review is highly desired in this area. However, existing surveys on 3D human pose estimation mainly focus on traditional methods and a comprehensive review on deep learning based methods remains lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of existing deep learning based works for 3D pose estimation, summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and provide an in-depth understanding of this area. Furthermore, we also explore the commonly-used benchmark datasets on which we conduct a comprehensive study for comparison and analysis. Our study sheds light on the state of research development in 3D human pose estimation and provides insights that can facilitate the future design of models and algorithms.},

Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

  abstract = {Background  The chemopreventive effect of green tea polyphenols, such as (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), has been well demonstrated in cell culture studies. However, a wide range of IC50 concentrations has been observed in published studies of the anti-proliferative activity of EGCG from different laboratories. Although the susceptibility to EGCG treatment is largely dependent on cancer cell type, the particular cell viability and proliferation assays utilized may significantly influence quantitative results reported in the literature. Methodology/Principal Findings  We compared five widely used methods to measure cell proliferation and viability after EGCG treatment using LNCaP prostate cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Both methods using dyes to quantify adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and deoxynucleic acid (DNA) showed accuracy in the measurement of viable cells when compared to trypan blue assay and results showed good linear correlation (r = 0.95). However, the use of MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) as indicators of metabolically active mitochondria overestimated the number of viable cells by comparison with the ATP, DNA, or trypan blue determinations. As a result, the observed IC50 concentration of EGCG was 2-fold higher using MTT and MTS compared to dyes quantifying ATP and DNA. In contrast, when cells were treated with apigenin MTT and MTS assays showed consistent results with ATP, DNA, or trypan blue assays. Conclusions/Significance  These results demonstrate that MTT and MTS -based assays will provide an underestimation of the anti-proliferative effect of EGCG, and suggest the importance of careful evaluation of the method for in vitro assessment of cell viability and proliferation depending on the chemical nature of botanical supplements.},

This study contrasted in vivo knee kinematics with an anterior cruciate ligament-substituting arthroplasty with and without PCL retention. We hypothesized that knees without PCLs would exhibit less femoral posterior translation, and consequently less maximum knee flexion. Fifty-six knees were studied using dynamic radiography at least one year post-surgery, with twenty-seven knees retaining the PCL and twenty-nine knees having the PCL sacrificed. Consistent with our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees showed more anterior femoral condylar positions. Contrary to our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees demonstrated greater knee flexion during kneeling (122{\textdegree} versus 115{\textdegree}). Contracted PCLs in severely deformed knees likely were the cause of limited flexion in some retaining knees.},

Methods{$\quad$} Nineteen unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and fourteen total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients who were well matched demographically and with high Oxford knee scores (OKS) for their operation type were evaluated at a minimum 1 year after their operation with downhill gait analysis. Nineteen healthy young subjects were used as controls. Downhill gait analysis was carried out on an instrumented treadmill that was ramped at the rear to produce a declination of 7{\textdegree}. All subjects after a period of habituation were tested for preferred and top downhill walking speed with associated ground reaction and temporospatial measurements. Results{$\quad$}The UKA group had higher mean OKS (44.8 {$\pm$} 2.9 vs 41.9 {$\pm$} 4.7, p = 0.03) as predicted. The UKA group walked downhill 15 \% faster than the TKA group (1.75 {$\pm$} 0.14 vs 1.52 {$\pm$} 0.13 m/s, p {$<$} 0.0001) despite having the same cadence (134.9 {$\pm$} 8.0 vs 133.9 {$\pm$} 9.6 steps/ min). This 15 \% difference in speed appeared largely due to a 15 \% increase in stride length (173 {$\pm$} 14 vs 150 {$\pm$} 17 cm, p = 0.0007) and normal weight acceptance, both of which were similar to the controls.

Our purpose was to determine the most reliable plane to evaluate supraspinatus fatty infiltration, assess reliability of the tangent sign, and to correlate fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy. Methods: Fatty infiltration in 87 computed tomography scans was reviewed by 3 shoulder surgeons using the 5-tiered Goutallier classification and a separate 3-grade scale. The supraspinatus muscle was evaluated in the axial, coronal, and sagittal plane. The tangent sign was used to assess muscle atrophy. Results: The axial plane produced the highest agreement for both the 5-tiered and 3-tiered systems. An objective radiographic marker was described to reliably determine grade 3 fatty infiltration. The tangent sign produced excellent agreement for the presence of muscle atrophy. A significant relationship between the tangent sign and fatty infiltration was discovered (P {$<$} .0001); grades 3 and 4 fatty infiltration correlated statistically with supraspinatus atrophy. Conclusion: The tangent sign is acceptable for determining the presence of muscle atrophy and clinical decision making. A positive tangent sign is an indicator of advanced fatty infiltration. The axial computed tomography plane should be used when evaluating fatty infiltration.},

Analyzing cartilage deformation during walking would provide spatial maps of displacement, strain, and enable viscoelastic characterization, which may serve as imaging biomarkers for early cartilage degeneration when the damage is still reversible. However, the time-dependent biomechanics of cartilage is not well described, and how defects in the joint impact the viscoelastic response is unclear. Methods We used spiral acquisition with displacement encoding MRI to quantify displacement and strain maps at a high frame rate (40 ms; 25 frames/sec) in tibiofemoral joints. We also employed relaxometry methods (T1, T1{$\rho$}, T2, T2*) on the cartilage. Results Normal and shear strains were concentrated on the tibiofemoral contact area during loading, and the defected joint exhibited larger compressive strains. We also determined a positive correlation between the change of T1{$\rho$} in cartilage after cyclic loading and increased compressive strain on the defected joint. Viscoelastic behavior was quantified by the time-dependent displacement, where the damaged joint showed increased creep behavior compared to the intact. Conclusions Our results indicate that spiral scanning with displacement encoding can quantitatively differentiate the damaged from intact joint using the strain and creep response. The viscoelastic response identified with this methodology could serve as biomarkers to detect defects in joints in vivo and facilitate the early diagnosis of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.},

Recent transfer learning approaches for behavioral tracking have considerably advanced the state of the art. Typically these methods treat each video frame and each object to be tracked independently. In this work, we improve on these methods (particularly in the regime of few training labels) by leveraging the rich spatiotemporal structures pervasive in behavioral video {\textemdash} specifically, the spatial statistics imposed by physical constraints (e.g., paw to elbow distance), and the temporal statistics imposed by smoothness from frame to frame. We propose a probabilistic graphical model built on top of deep neural networks, Deep Graph Pose (DGP), to leverage these useful spatial and temporal constraints, and develop an efficient structured variational approach to perform inference in this model. The resulting semi-supervised model exploits both labeled and unlabeled frames to achieve significantly more accurate and robust tracking while requiring users to label fewer training frames. In turn, these tracking improvements enhance performance on downstream applications, including robust unsupervised segmentation of behavioral ``syllables,'' and estimation of interpretable ``disentangled'' low-dimensional representations of the full behavioral video.

The algorithm is composed of two iterated steps, the first of which determines correspondences between imagefeatures and model data, while the second computes the 3 - 0rigid body transformation that minimizes the displacement of matched points. As camera images do not yieldfull 3-0 information, the key idea proposed is to exploit the inverse perspective, ie. the projection ray determined by the focal point of the camera and an image feature point. The inverse perspective yields the constraints for both correspondence search and pose estimation in 3-0 space rather than in the imageplane. This not only simplifies motion parameter estimation but also reduces matching ambiguities due to occlusions. In addition, a robust M-estimation technique reduces the impact of fulse CO rrespondences.},

We systematically reviewed the data from published studies to determine the effect of intraoperative neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium. Methods: Studies were identified by searching the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine (1966 to 2003) for terms related to cognitive dysfunction after surgery. Inclusion criteria were a comparison of intraoperative neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia, and the outcome of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. A total of 196 abstracts were identified, and 24 articles were analyzed. Each article was reviewed, and data were extracted from tables or text or extrapolated from figures as needed. Results: Of the 24 trials obtained, 19 were randomized and 4 were observational (nonrandomized) trials (1 trial was a combination of randomized and observational data). The age of patients studied was typically greater than 60 years, and a wide range of neuropsychometric tests were used to evaluate cognitive function. The majority of trials (23/24 of all trials and 18/19 of randomized trials) did not demonstrate a benefit from neuraxial anesthesia in decreasing the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Conclusions: The use of intraoperative neuraxial anesthesia does not appear to decrease the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction when compared with general anesthesia. There are methodologic and study-design issues present in many studies, and further elucidation of the pathophysiology of postoperative cognitive dysfunction may provide a direction for future studies.

In this work, we challenge this paradigm: we instead (a) represent images as a set of visual tokens and (b) apply visual transformers to find relationships between visual semantic concepts. Given an input image, we dynamically extract a set of visual tokens from the image to obtain a compact representation for high-level semantics. We then use visual transformers to operate over the visual tokens to densely model relationships between them. We find that this paradigm of token-based image representation and processing drastically outperforms its convolutional counterparts on image classification and semantic segmentation. To demonstrate the power of this approach on ImageNet classification, we use ResNet as a convenient baseline and use visual transformers to replace the last stage of convolutions. This reduces the stage's MACs by up to 6.9x, while attaining up to 4.53 points higher top-1 accuracy. For semantic segmentation, we use a visual-transformer-based FPN (VT-FPN) module to replace a convolution-based FPN, saving 6.5x fewer MACs while achieving up to 0.35 points higher mIoU on LIP and COCO-stuff.},

While supervised learning algorithms have achieved excellent performance in this area, they require a large amount of annotated data, which is often time-consuming and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has gained attention as it has the potential to alleviate this challenge by using not only limited labelled data but also a large amount of unlabelled data. A common approach in SSL is to filter out high-entropy features and use the low-entropy part to compute unsupervised loss. However, it is believed that the high-entropy part is also beneficial for model training, and discarding it can lead to information loss. To address this issue, a simple yet efficient contrastive learning approach is proposed in this work for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, called Entropy-Guided Contrastive Learning Segmentation Network (EGCL-Net). The proposed method separates the low-entropy and high-entropy features via the average of predictions, using contrastive loss to pull the intra-class entropy representation distance close and push the inter-class entropy representation distance away. Extensive experiments on the automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset, COVID-19, and BraTS2019 datasets showed that: (1) EGCL-Net can significantly improve performance by utilizing high-entropy representation, and (2) the authors' EGCL-Net outperforms recent state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.},

Experimental Design: Dataset A consists of 179 patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation, with pretreatment and posttreatment CT images at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up (581 scans). Models were developed using transfer learning of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with recurrent neural networks (RNN), using single seed-point tumor localization. Pathologic response validation was performed on dataset B, comprising 89 patients with NSCLC treated with chemoradiation and surgery (178 scans).  Results:  Deep learning models using time series scans were significantly predictive of survival and cancer-specific outcomes (progression, distant metastases, and local-regional recurrence). Model performance was enhanced with each additional follow-up scan into the CNN model (e.g., 2-year overall survival: AUC = 0.74, P   Conclusions:  We demonstrate that deep learning can integrate imaging scans at multiple timepoints to improve clinical outcome predictions.

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2-D)/three-dimensional (3-D) registration techniques using single-plane fluoroscopy are highly important for analyzing 3-D kinematics in applications such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants. The accuracy of single-plane fluoroscopy-based techniques in the determination of translation perpendicular to the image plane (depth position), however, is relatively poor because a change in the depth position causes only small changes in the 2-D silhouette. Accuracies achieved in depth position using conventional 2-D/3-D registration techniques are insufficient for clinical applications. Therefore, we propose a technique for improving the accuracy of depth position determination in order to develop a system for analyzing knee kinematics over the full six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) using single-plane fluoroscopy. In preliminary experiments, the behaviors of errors for each free variable were quantified as evaluation curves by examining changes in cost function with variations in the free variable. The evaluation curve for depth position was more jagged, and the curve peak less pointy, compared to the evaluation curves of the other five variables, and the curve was found to behave differently. Depth position is therefore optimized independently of the other variables, using an approximate evaluation curve of depth position prepared after initial registration. Accuracy of the proposed technique was evaluated by computer simulation and in vitro tests, with validation of absolute position and orientation performed for each knee component. In computer simulation tests, root-mean-square error (RMSE) in depth position was improved from 2.6 mm (conventional) to 0.9 mm (proposed), whereas for in vitro tests, RMSE improved from 3.2 mm to 1.4 mm. Accuracy of the estimation of the remaining two translational and three rotational variables was found to be almost the same as that obtained by conventional techniques. Results of in vivo tests are also described in which the possibility of full 6 DOF kinematic analysis of TKA implants is shown.},

In vivo kinametcis of the metallic knee implant was determined using a 2D/3D registration technique, which uses computer assisted design (CAD) model of the implant to estimate the 3D pose of radiopaque metallic femoral and tibial components from a single-plane fluoroscopic image. In fixed-bearing TKA, a 3D pose of radiolucent tibial polyethylene insert can be determined from the estimated pose of the tibial component. To visualize femorotibial contact, the proximity between surfaces of femoral component and tibial insert was calculated, and mapped onto the insert surface model. For the clinical application, dynamic states of contact on the tibial insert were observed including axial rotation and unilateral loading during knee flexion, and post-cam contact of posterior stabilized TKA. The present technique provided us new information and enabled us to better understand the relationship between in vivo knee kinematics and articular shape of the implant.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of combinations of resveratrol and quercetin on adipogenesis and apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells. In maturing preadipocytes resveratrol and quercetin at 25 {$\mu$}M individually suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation by 9.4{$\pm$}3.9\% (pb0.01) and 15.9{$\pm$}2.5\%, respectively, (pb0.001). The combination of resveratrol and quercetin at the same dose, however, decreased lipid accumulation by 68.6{$\pm$}0.7\% (pb0.001). In addition, combinations of resveratrol and quercetin at 25 {$\mu$}M significantly decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP){$\alpha$}, both of which act as key transcription factors. In mature adipocytes resveratrol and quercetin at 100 {$\mu$}M individually decreased viability by 18.1{$\pm$}0.6\% (pb0.001) and 15.8{$\pm$}1\% (pb0.001) and increased apoptosis (100 {$\mu$}M) by 120.5{$\pm$}8.3\% (pb0.001) and 85.3{$\pm$}10\% (pb0.001) at 48 h, respectively. Combinations of resveratrol and quercetin further decreased viability (73.5{$\pm$}0.9\%, pb0.001) and increased apoptosis (310.3{$\pm$}9.6\%, pb0.001) more than single compounds alone. The combination of resveratrol and quercetin at 100 {$\mu$}M increased release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and decreased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data indicate that combinations of resveratrol and quercetin can exert potential anti-obesity effects by inhibiting differentiation of preadipocytes and inducing apoptosis of mature adipocytes.},

We investigated the effects of esculetin, a coumarin compound, on apoptotic signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Esculetin treatment induced an increase in expression of Bax with a concomitant decrease of Bcl-2 in a time-dependent manner. Esculetin treatment also resulted in translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and cleavage of 116 kDa poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, resulting in the accumulation of an 85 kDa cleavage product in a caspase-dependent manner. Furthermore, esculetin selectively altered the phosphorylation state of members of the MAPK superfamily, causing dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulating kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and hyperphosphorylation of c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, an inhibitor of the JNK MAP kinase pathway, SP600125, reduced esculetininduced cytochrome c release. These results indicate that esculetin mediated adipocyte apoptosis involves the mitochondrial pathway. Esculetin thus decreases adipocyte number by initiating this apoptotic process in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.},

Object shape is a meaningful and informative cue in object recognition, where an effective shape descriptor plays an important role. To capture the invariant features of both local shape details and visual parts, we propose a novel invariant multi-scale descriptor for shape matching and retrieval. In this work, we define three types of invariants to capture the shape features from different aspects. Each type of the invariants is used in multiple scales from a local range to a semi-global part. An adaptive discrete contour evolution method is also proposed to extract the salient feature points of a shape contour for compact representation. Shape matching is performed using the dynamic programming algorithm. The proposed method is invariant to rotation, scale variation, intra-class variation, articulated deformation and partial occlusion. Our method is robust to noise as well. To validate the invariance and robustness of our proposed method, we perform experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including MPEG-7, Kimia and articulated shape datasets. The competitive results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method for shape matching and retrieval.},

Research Methods and Procedures: Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with ajoene at concentrations up to 200 {$\mu$}M. Viability and apoptosis were quantified using an MTS-based cell viability assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured based on production of the fluorescent dye, dichlorofluorescein. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulating kinase 1/2 (ERK) and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) was shown by Western blot. Western blot was also used to show activation of caspase-3, translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to nucleus, and cleavage of 116-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1. Results: Ajoene induced apoptosis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ajoene treatment resulted in activation of JNK and ERK, translocation of AIF from mitochondria to nucleus, and cleavage of 116-kDa PARP-1 in a caspase-independent manner. Ajoene treatment also induced an increase in intracellular ROS level. Furthermore, the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine effectively blocked ajoene-mediated ROS generation, activation of JNK and ERK, translocation of AIF, and degradation of PARP-1. Discussion: These results indicate that ajoene-induced apoptosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is initiated by the generation of hydrogen peroxide, which leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, degradation of PARP-1, translocation of AIF, and fragmentation of DNA. Ajoene can, thus, influence the regulation of fat cell number through the induction of apoptosis and may be a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of obesity.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers and carries a dismal prognosis of    {$\sim$}   10\% in five year survival rate. Surgery remains the best option of a potential cure for patients who are evaluated to be eligible for initial resection of PDAC. However, outcomes vary significantly even among the resected patients who were the same cancer stage and received similar treatments. Accurate quantitative preoperative prediction of primary resectable PDACs for personalized cancer treatment is thus highly desired. Nevertheless, there are a very few automated methods yet to fully exploit the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) imaging for PDAC prognosis assessment. CE-CT plays a critical role in PDAC staging and resectability evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network model for the survival prediction of primary resectable PDAC patients, named as 3D Contrast-Enhanced Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (CE-ConvLSTM), which can derive the tumor attenuation signatures or patterns from patient CE-CT imaging studies. Tumor-vascular relationships, which might indicate the resection margin status, have also been proven to hold strong relationships with the overall survival of PDAC patients. To capture such relationships, we propose a self-learning approach for automated pancreas and peripancreatic anatomy segmentation without requiring any annotations on our PDAC datasets. We then employ a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to accomplish both tasks of survival outcome and margin prediction where the network benefits from learning the resection margin related image features to improve the survival prediction. Our presented framework can improve overall survival prediction performances compared with existing state-of-the-art survival analysis approaches. The new staging biomarker integrating both the proposed risk signature and margin prediction has evidently added values to be combined with the current clinical staging system.},

This article seeks to provide an overview of emerging mathematical methods with the potential to improve the abilities of clinicians and researchers to analyze biomedical data, but may be hindered from doing so by a lack of conceptual accessibility and awareness in the life sciences research community. In particular, we focus on topological data analysis (TDA) , a set of methods grounded in the mathematical field of algebraic topology that seeks to describe and harness features related to the ``shape'' of data. We aim to make such techniques more approachable to non-mathematicians by providing a conceptual discussion of their theoretical foundations followed by a survey of their published applications to scientific research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and suggest potential avenues for future work integrating mathematical tools into clinical care and biomedical informatics.},

  abstract = {Abstract Machine learning, and especially deep learning, is rapidly gaining acceptance and clinical usage in a wide range of image analysis applications and is regarded as providing high performance in detecting anatomical structures and identification and classification of patterns of disease in medical images. However, there are many roadblocks to the widespread implementation of machine learning in clinical image analysis, including differences in data capture leading to different measurements, high dimensionality of imaging and other medical data, and the black-box nature of machine learning, with a lack of insight into relevant features. Techniques such as radiomics have been used in traditional machine learning approaches to model the mathematical relationships between adjacent pixels in an image and provide an explainable framework for clinicians and researchers. Newer paradigms, such as topological data analysis (TDA), have recently been adopted to design and develop innovative image analysis schemes that go beyond the abilities of pixel-to-pixel comparisons. TDA can automatically construct filtrations of topological shapes of image texture through a technique known as persistent homology (PH); these features can then be fed into machine learning models that provide explainable outputs and can distinguish different image classes in a computationally more efficient way, when compared to other currently used methods. The aim of this review is to introduce PH and its variants and to review TDA's recent successes in medical imaging studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract As a common cause of shoulder pain, rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are difficult to treat clinically because of their unsatisfactory prognosis due to the fatty infiltration caused by muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs). Previous studies have found that rapamycin (RAPA) can inhibit fatty infiltration. However, systemic administration of RAPA may cause complications such as infection and nausea, while local administration of RAPA may lead to the cytotoxicity of tendon cells, affecting the healing of rotator cuffs. In this study, biocompatible and clinically approved polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol (PCL-PEG) is formulated into an injectable nanoparticle for the sustained release of RAPA. The results indicate that the RAPA/PCL-PEG nanoparticles (NPs) can efficiently prolong the release of RAPA and significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of tendon cells caused by RAPA. The study of the fatty infiltration model in rats with delayed rotator cuff repair shows that weekly intraarticular injection of RAPA/PCL-PEG NPs can more effectively reduce the fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy of rat rotator cuffs and leads to better mechanical properties and gait improvements than a daily intraarticular injection of RAPA. These findings imply that local injection of RAPA/PCL-PEG NPs in the shoulder joints can be a potential clinical option for RCTs patients with fatty infiltration.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Quadriceps weakness is one of the primary post-operative impairments that persist long term for patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesized that early gait muscle recruitment patterns of the quadriceps and hamstrings with diminished knee performance at 3 months after surgery would be related to long-term quadriceps strength at 1 year after TKA. Methods: Twenty-one subjects who underwent primary unilateral TKA and 14 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed. At 3 months after TKA, the maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps and a comprehensive gait analysis were performed. Quadriceps strength was assessed again at 1 year after surgery. Results: Quadriceps muscle recruitment of the operated limb was greater than the non-operated limb during the loading response of gait (p = 0.03), but there were no significant differences in hamstring recruitment or co-contraction between limbs (p {$>$} 0.05). There were significant differences in quadriceps muscle recruitment during gait between the non-operated limbs of the TKA group and the healthy control group (p b 0.05). The TKA group showed a significant inverse relationship between one year quadriceps strength and co-contraction (r = -0.543) and hamstring muscle recruitment (r = - 0.480) during loading response at 3 months after TKA. Conclusions: The results revealed a reverse relationship where stronger patients tended to demonstrate lower quadriceps recruitment at 3 months post-surgery that was not observed in the healthy peer group. The altered neuromuscular patterns of the quadriceps and hamstrings during gait may influence chronic quadriceps strength in individuals after TKA.},

Excessive adipose tissue contributes to dysfunctional and metabolically impaired muscle. How these adipose tissues change during orthopedic treatment (e.g., cast immobilization, daily use of crutches) is not well documented. This study aimed to quantify changes in IntraMAT, InterMAT, and thigh and calf muscle tissue during orthopedic treatment. We studied 8 patients with fifth metatarsal bone or fibular fractures. The ankle joint involved underwent plaster casting for approximately 4weeks, with crutches used during that time. Axial T1-weighted MRI at the mid-thigh and a 30\% proximal site at the calf were obtained to measure IntraMAT and InterMAT cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and skeletal muscle tissue CSA before treatment and 4weeks afterward. Thigh and calf muscle tissue CSAs were significantly decreased from before to after treatment: thigh, 85.8{$\pm$}7.6 to 77.1{$\pm$}7.3cm2; calf, 53.3{$\pm$}5.5 to 48.9{$\pm$}5.0cm2 (p{$<$}0.05). None of the IntraMAT or InterMAT changes was statistically significant. There was a relation between the percentage change of thigh IntraMAT CSA and muscle tissue CSA (rs=-0.86, p{$<$}0.01). The 4weeks of treatment primarily induced skeletal muscle atrophy with less of an effect on IntraMAT or InterMAT. There is a risk of increasing IntraMAT relatively by decreasing skeletal muscle tissue size during orthopedic treatment.},

This research investigates this assumption by examining six public and private databases that contain structural information for chemicals. Molecular fingerprinting techniques are used to determine the error rates for structures in each of the databases. It was observed that the databases had error rates ranging from 0.1 to 3.4\%. A case study to predict the n-octanol/water partition coefficient was also investigated to highlight the effects of these errors in the predictions of QSARs. In this case study, QSARs were developed using both (i) all correct structures and (ii) structures from a database with an error rate of 3.4\%. This case study showed how slight errors in chemical structures, such as misplacing a Cl atom or swapping hydroxy and methoxy functional groups on a multiple ring structure, can result in significant differences in the accuracy of the prediction for those chemicals.},

A three-dimensional (3-D) model-based method is presented to estimate skeletal motion of the knee from high-speed sequences of biplane radiographs. The method implicitly assumes that geometrical features cannot be detected reliably and an exact segmentation of bone edges is not always feasible. An existing biplane radiograph system was simulated as two separate single-plane radiograph systems. Position and orientation of the underlying bone was determined for each single-plane view by generating projections through a 3-D volumetric model (from computed tomography), and producing an image (digitally reconstructed radiograph) similar (based on texture information and rough edges of bone) to the two{\textendash}dimensional radiographs. The absolute 3-D pose was determined using known imaging geometry of the biplane radiograph system and a 3-D line intersection method. Results were compared to data of known accuracy, obtained from a previously established bone-implanted marker method. Difference of controlled in vitro tests was on the order of 0.5 mm for translation and 1.4 for rotation. A biplane radiograph sequence of a canine hindlimb during treadmill walking was used for in vivo testing, with differences on the order of 0.8 mm for translation and 2.5 for rotation.},

Motivated by the empirical observation that the label predictions of interior pixels are more reliable, we propose to replace the originally unreliable predictions of boundary pixels by the predictions of interior pixels. Our approach processes only the input image through two steps: (i) localize the boundary pixels and (ii) identify the corresponding interior pixel for each boundary pixel. We build the correspondence by learning a direction away from the boundary pixel to an interior pixel. Our method requires no prior information of the segmentation models and achieves nearly real-time speed. We empirically verify that our SegFix consistently reduces the boundary errors for segmentation results generated from various stateof-the-art models on Cityscapes, ADE20K and GTA5.

  abstract = {Data augmentation (DA) has been widely utilized to improve generalization in training deep neural networks. Recently, human-designed data augmentation has been gradually replaced by automatically learned augmentation policy. Through finding the best policy in well-designed search space of data augmentation, AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2018) can significantly improve validation accuracy on image classification tasks. However, this approach is not computationally practical for large-scale problems. In this paper, we develop an adversarial method to arrive at a computationally-affordable solution called Adversarial AutoAugment, which can simultaneously optimize target related object and augmentation policy search loss. The augmentation policy network attempts to increase the training loss of a target network through generating adversarial augmentation policies, while the target network can learn more robust features from harder examples to improve the generalization. In contrast to prior work, we reuse the computation in target network training for policy evaluation, and dispense with the retraining of the target network. Compared to AutoAugment, this leads to about 12{\texttimes} reduction in computing cost and 11{\texttimes} shortening in time overhead on ImageNet. We show experimental results of our approach on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art. On CIFAR-10, we achieve a top-1 test error of 1.36\%, which is the currently best performing single model. On ImageNet, we achieve a leading performance of top-1 accuracy 79.40\% on ResNet-50 and 80.00\% on ResNet-50-D without extra data.},

  abstract = {Abstract   In recent years, approaches based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in point cloud learning. The typical pipeline of GCNs is modeled as a two-stage learning process: graph construction and feature learning. We argue that such process exhibits low efciency because a high percentage of the total time is consumed during the graph construction process when a large amount of sparse data are required to be accessed rather than on actual feature learning. To alleviate this problem, we propose a graph-based parallel branch network (Graph-PBN) that introduces a parallel branch structure to point cloud learning in this study. In particular, Graph-PBN is composed of two branches: the PointNet branch and the GCN branch. PointNet exhibits advantages in memory access and computational cost, while GCN behaves better in local context modeling. The two branches are combined in our architecture to utilize the potential of PointNet and GCN fully, facilitating the achievement of efcient and accurate recognition results. To better aggregate the features of each node in GCN, we investigate a novel operator, called EAGConv, to augment their local context by fully utilizing geometric and semantic features in a local graph. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, and experiment results validate the signicant performance of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be made publicly available at  https://github.com/zhangcheng828/Graph-PBN .},

  abstract = {The renaissance of deep learning has provided promising solutions to various tasks. While conventional deep learning models are constructed for a single specific task, multi-task deep learning (MTDL) that is capable to simultaneously accomplish at least two tasks has attracted research attention. MTDL is a joint learning paradigm that harnesses the inherent correlation of multiple related tasks to achieve reciprocal benefits in improving performance, enhancing generalizability, and reducing the overall computational cost. This review focuses on the advanced applications of MTDL for medical image computing and analysis. We first summarize four popular MTDL network architectures (i.e., cascaded, parallel, interacted, and hybrid). Then, we review the representative MTDL-based networks for eight application areas, including the brain, eye, chest, cardiac, abdomen, musculoskeletal, pathology, and other human body regions. While MTDL-based medical image processing has been flourishing and demonstrating outstanding performance in many tasks, in the meanwhile, there are performance gaps in some tasks, and accordingly we perceive the open challenges and the perspective trends. For instance, in the 2018 Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation challenge, the reported top dice score of 0.51 and top recall of 0.55 achieved by the cascaded MTDL model indicate further research efforts in high demand to escalate the performance of current models.},

In the present study, we explored the mechanism responsible for the antilipolytic effect of berberine in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was shown that berberine attenuated lipolysis induced by catecholamines, cAMP-raising agents, and a hydrolyzable cAMP analog, but not by tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$} and a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog. Unlike insulin, the inhibitory effect of berberine on lipolysis in response to isoproterenol was not abrogated by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but additive to that of PD98059, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor. Prior exposure of adipocytes to berberine decreased the intracellular cAMP production induced by isoproterenol, forskolin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), along with hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) Ser-563 and Ser-660 dephosphorylation, but had no effect on perilipin phosphorylation. Berberine stimulated HSL Ser-565 as well as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. However, compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, did not reverse the regulatory effect of berberine on HSL Ser-563, Ser-660, and Ser-565 phosphorylation, nor the antilipolytic effect of berberine. Knockdown of AMPK using RNA interference also failed to restore berberine-suppressed lipolysis. cAMP-raising agents increased AMPK activity, which was not additive to that of berberine. Stimulation of adipocytes with berberine increased phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3B and PDE4 activity measured by hydrolysis of  3 [H]cAMP. These results suggest that berberine exerts an antilipolytic effect mainly by reducing the inhibition of PDE, leading to a decrease in cAMP and HSL phosphorylation independent of AMPK pathway.},

We argue that the optimizer would deal with an easier learning task when the feature maps from the decoder and encoder networks are semantically similar. We have evaluated UNet++ in comparison with U-Net and wide U-Net architectures across multiple medical image segmentation tasks: nodule segmentation in the lowdose CT scans of chest, nuclei segmentation in the microscopy images, liver segmentation in abdominal CT scans, and polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos. Our experiments demonstrate that UNet++ with deep supervision achieves an average IoU gain of 3.9 and 3.4 points over U-Net and wide U-Net, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background: Rotator cuff (RC) muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration (FI) are independent factors correlated with failure of attempted tendon repair in larger RC tears. However, there is no effective treatment for RC muscle atrophy and FI at this time. The recent discovery of beige adipose tissue (BAT) in adults shed light on a new avenue in treating obesity and excessive fat deposition by promoting BAT activity. The goal of this study was to define the role of intramuscular BAT in RC muscle FI and the effect of {$\beta$} 3 -adrenergic receptor agonists in treating RC muscle FI by promoting BAT activity. Materials and methods: Three-month-old wild-type C57BL/6J, platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR {$\alpha$} ) green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) knockout mice underwent a unilateral RC injury procedure, which included supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus tendon resection and suprascapular nerve transection. To stimulate BATactivity, amibegron, a selective {$\beta$} 3 -adrenergic receptor agonist, was administered to C57BL/6J mice either on the same day as surgery or 6 weeks after surgery through daily intraperitoneal injections. Gait analysis was conducted to measure forelimb Results: Histologic analysis of SS muscles from PDGFR {$\alpha$} -GFP reporter mice showed that PDGFR {$\alpha$} -positive fibroadipogenic progenitors in RC muscle expressed UCP-1, a hallmark of BAT during the development of FI after RC tears. Impairing BAT activity by knocking out UCP-1 resulted in more severe muscle atrophy and FI with inferior forelimb function in UCP-1 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. Promoting BAT activity with amibegron significantly reduced muscle atrophy and FI after RC tears and improved forelimb function. Delayed treatment with amibegron reversed muscle atrophy and FI in muscle. Conclusions: Fat accumulated in muscle after RC tears possesses BAT characteristics. Impairing BAT activity results in worse RC muscle atrophy and FI. Amibegron reduces and reverses RC atrophy and FI by promoting BAT activity.},

Kinematic and kinetic information of a TKA is crucial for the improvement of implant designs and for the increased longevity of the implant components. Instrumented gait analysis, with skin mounted marker tracking and force plates, is a well-established method for the acquisition of kinematic and kinetic data of TKA in vivo and for non-invasive estimation of joint function. However, resultant moments at the knee joint are inaccurate with this method, due to skin movement artifacts. Video-fluoroscopy reduces these inaccuracies by means of the direct tracking of the implant components with X-ray. However this measuring technique carries disadvantages: it provides only kinematic data, and the image intensifier covers a limited field of view. This paper presents a newly developed measuring technique, which enables a more accurate resultant moments calculation for level walking than could be achieved by conventional instrumented gait analysis.},

The method is based on two different X-ray image sets: a rotational series of acquisitions of the still subject knee that allows the tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional volume (model), and a stereoscopic image series of orthogonal projections as the subject performs movements. Tracking the movements of bones throughout the stereoscopic image series means to determine, for each frame, the best pose of every moving element (bone) previously identified in the 3D reconstructed model. The quality of a pose is reflected in the similarity between its theoretical projections and the actual radiographs. We use direct Fourier reconstruction to approximate the three-dimensional volume of the knee joint. Then, to avoid the expensive computation of digitally rendered radiographs (DRR) for pose recovery, we develop a corollary to the 3-dimensional central-slice theorem and reformulate the tracking problem in the Fourier domain. Under the hypothesis of parallel X-ray beams, the heavy 2D-to-3D registration of projections in the signal domain is replaced by efficient slice-tovolume registration in the Fourier domain. Focusing on rotational movements, the translation-relevant phase information can be discarded and we only consider scalar Fourier amplitudes. The core of our motion tracking algorithm can be implemented as a classical frame-wise slice-to-volume registration task. Results on both synthetic and real images confirm the validity of our approach.},

  abstract = {A better knowledge of the kinematics behavior of total knee replacement (TKR) during activity still remains a crucial issue to validate innovative prosthesis designs and different surgical strategies. Tools for more accurate measurement of in vivo kinematics of knee prosthesis components are therefore fundamental to improve the clinical outcome of knee replacement. In the present study, a novel model-based method for the estimation of the three-dimensional (3-D) position and orientation (pose) of both the femoral and tibial knee prosthesis components during activity is presented. The knowledge of the 3-D geometry of the components and a single plane projection view in a fluoroscopic image are sufficient to reconstruct the absolute and relative pose of the components in space. The technique is based on the best alignment of the component designs with the corresponding projection on the image plane. The image generation process is modeled and an iterative procedure localizes the spatial pose of the object by minimizing the Euclidean distance of the projection rays from the object surface. Computer simulation and static/dynamic in vitro tests using real knee prosthesis show that the accuracy with which relative orientation and position of the components can be estimated is better than 1.5  and 1.5 mm, respectively. In vivo tests demonstrate that the method is well suited for kinematics analysis on TKR patients and that good quality images can be obtained with a carefully positioning of the fluoroscope and an appropriate dosage. With respect to previously adopted template matching techniques, the present method overcomes the complete segmentation of the components on the projected image and also features the simultaneous evaluation of all the six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the object. The expected small difference between successive poses in in vivo sequences strongly reduces the frequency of false poses and both the operator and computation time.},
