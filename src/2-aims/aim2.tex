While establishing a pipeline for the fully autonomous measurements of TKA kinematics, we encountered many of the different limitations present in using single-plane fluoroscopy. Fundamentally, this is a problem that exists inherently in the system, as you have a severely underconstrained problem, leading us to the inverse problem of computer vision (\cref{def:inverse-problem}).

\begin{mdframed}
	\begin{definition}[Inverse Problem]
		The inverse problem in computer vision is the process of calculating the causal factors (kinematics) that produced a set of observations (fluoroscopic images).
		\label{def:inverse-problem}
	\end{definition}
\end{mdframed}

One of the more pernicious limitations in single-plane fluoroscopy is an issue that we've dubbed the ``symmetry trap'', which causes multiple global minima when using a strictly contour-based objective function. The major contributor to these issues is symmetric tibial implants, which are mediolaterally symmetric (i.e. no different between right and left implants).

\begin{mdframed}
	\begin{definition}[Symmetry Trap]
		A symmetry trap occurs when a symmetric object has a projective geometry with more than one unique pose that can produce it. The simplest case is a sphere, where all poses produce the same circular projective geometry.
	\end{definition}
\end{mdframed}

This aim focuses on establishing a post-processing pipeline that can be used to address symmetry traps fully autonomously, solving an issue facing researchers studying single-plane kinematics for nearly 30 years! We also propose imaging recommendations to reduce the occurrence of symmetry traps in clinical data.
