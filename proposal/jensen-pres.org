* Motivation
** The Problem
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
+ Joints manifest pain during dynamic activity.
+ 20% of patients receiving TKA are dissatisfied.
  + Instability, pain, unnatural [cite:@bakerRolePainFunction2007; @bournePatientSatisfactionTotal2010; @scottPredictingDissatisfactionFollowing2010].
+ No reliable method of clinically assessing and quantifying joint dynamics.
  + Too much human supervision, too time consuming

** Our Proposition
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
Orthopaedic surgeons and clinicians would readily adopt a practical and inexpensive technology that allows them to measure a patient's knee kinematics during activities of daily living.

** Constraints
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.45
:END:
+ It must fit within a standard clinical workflow
+ The technology must utilize equipment commonly found in hospitals
+ There must not be significant human supervision nor interaction to generate an examination report.

* Background
** Projective Geometry
** Camera Intrinsics
** Model-Image Registration

* Historical Methods
** Overview
Many different approaches have attempted to solve the model-image registration problem.
+ Pre-computed projections
+ Skin-mounted motion Capture
+ Biplane Imaging
+ Iterative Projections
** Pre-Computed Projections
** Skin-mounted Motion Capture
** Biplane Imaging
