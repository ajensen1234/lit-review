I would like to thank the McJunkin Family Charitable Foundation for their generous grant that supports this work.

** The Problem
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
+ Joints manifest pain during dynamic activity.
+ 20% of patients receiving TKA are dissatisfied.
  + Instability, pain, unnatural [cite:@bakerRolePainFunction2007; @bournePatientSatisfactionTotal2010; @scottPredictingDissatisfactionFollowing2010].
+ No reliable method of clinically assessing and quantifying joint dynamics.
  + Too much human supervision, too time consuming

** Our Proposition
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
Orthopaedic surgeons and clinicians would readily adopt a practical and inexpensive technology that allows them to measure a patient's knee kinematics during activities of daily living.

** Constraints
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.45
:END:
+ It must fit within a standard clinical workflow
+ The technology must utilize equipment commonly found in hospitals
+ There must not be significant human supervision nor interaction to generate an examination report.

* Background
** Projective Geometry
** Camera Intrinsics
** Model-Image Registration

* Historical Methods
** Overview
Many different approaches have attempted to solve the model-image registration problem.
+ Pre-computed projections
+ Skin-mounted motion Capture
+ Biplane Imaging
+ Iterative Projections
** Pre-Computed Projections
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
+ Saving space and memory by pre-computing as much as possible.
+ Pre-computed distance maps [cite:@zuffiModelbasedMethodReconstruction1999; @lavalleeRecoveringPositionOrientation1995].
+ Pre-computed shape libraries [cite:@banksAccurateMeasurementThreedimensional1996]

** Limitations of Pre-Computed Projections
+ Requires an accurate contour from the input image in order to perform calculations.
  + Human supervision vs. inaccuracy.

** Motion Capture (MoCap)
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
+ Can measure motion of MoCap beads very accurately.
+ Skin-mounted [cite:@gaoInvestigationSoftTissue2008; @kuoInfluenceSoftTissue2011; @linEffectsSoftTissue2016].
+ Bone pins [cite:@lafortuneThreedimensionalKinematicsHuman1992] (any volunteers?).

** Limitations of Motion Capture
Skin Mounted
+ Doesn't accurately describe underlying skeletal motion with clinical accuracy [cite:@gaoInvestigationSoftTissue2008; @kuoInfluenceSoftTissue2011; @linEffectsSoftTissue2016].
Bone Pins
+ Bone Pins
+ Need I say more?
** Biplane Imaging
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width \textwidth
+ Utilizes multiple cameras to resolve 3D position and orientation[cite:@ivesterReconfigurableHighSpeedStereoRadiography2015; @burtonAutomaticTrackingHealthy2021].
  + Highly accurate.
  + Gold Standard.

[[file:~/repo/lit-review/figures/raster/ivester-stereo-projection.png]]
** Limitations of Biplane Imaging
+ Not many hospitals have biplane fluoroscopy setups.
+ Clinically impractical

** Iterative Projections
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
+ Take advantage of modern computational graphics pipelines to quickly perform projection matching.
+ Image/Intensity similarity metrics [cite:@mahfouzRobustMethodRegistration2003]
+ Feature/Contour similarity metrics

** Limitations of (historic) Iterative Projection Methods
+ Requires human supervision for:
  + Pose initialization
  + Escaping local minima
  + Implant detection
+ Chaotic and Noisy objective function

** Model-based Roentgen Stereophotogrammetry (MBRSA)
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
+ Uses implanted tantalum beads for motion tracking [cite:@selvikRoentgenStereophotogrammetryMethod1989]
+ Extremely accurate [cite:@kapteinEvaluationThreePose2004; @saariKneeKinematicsMedial2005]
+ Gold standard Measurement [cite:@brobergValidationMachineLearning2023]
